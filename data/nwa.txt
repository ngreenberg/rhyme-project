[[Fuck tha Police]]
[Produced by Dr. Dre & DJ Yella]

[Intro: The D.O.C., Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube]
Right about now, N.W.A. court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A. versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy-motherfucking-E
Order, order, order!
Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth to help your black ass?
You goddamn right!
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Fuck the police! Comin' straight from the underground[1]
A young nigga got it bad ‘cause I'm brown[1]
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority[2] to kill a minority[2]
Fuck that shit, ‘cause I ain't the one[3]
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun[3]
To be beating on, and thrown in jail[4]
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell[4]
Fuckin' with me ‘cause I'm a teenager[5]
With a little bit of gold and a pager[5]
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product[6]
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics[6]
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo[7] rollin' in a Benz-o[7]
Beat a police out of shape[8]
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape[8]
To tape off the scene of the slaughter[9]
Still getting swoll off bread and water[9]
I don't know if they fags or what[10]
Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts[10]
And on the other hand, without a gun,[11] they can't get none[11]
But don't let it be a black and a white one[11]
‘Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top[12]
Black police showing out for the white cop[12]
Ice Cube will swarm[13]
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform[13]
Just ‘cause I'm from the CPT[14]
Punk police are afraid of me[14]
Huh, a young nigga on the warpath[15]
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath[15]
Of cops, dying in L.A[16]
Yo, Dre, I got something to say[16]

[Hook]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

[Skit 1: Cop, MC Ren, & Dr. Dre]
Pull your goddamn ass over right now!
Aww shit, now, what the fuck you pullin' me over for?
‘Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!
Man, fuck this shit!
A'ight, smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Fuck the police! And Ren said it with authority[17]
Because the niggas on the street is a majority[17]
A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'[18]
And the motherfuckin' weapon[18] is kept in[18]
A stash box, for the so-called law[19]
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw[19]
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh[20]
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path[20]
For police, I'm saying, "Fuck you, punk!"[23]
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk[23]
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand[24]
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand[24]
But take off the gun so you can see what's up[25]
And we'll go at it, punk[25], and I'ma fuck you up![25]
Make you think I'ma kick your ass[26]
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast[26]
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime[27]
But I'ma smoke them now and not next time[27]
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope[28]
Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope[28] with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad[29]
With potential to get bad[29] as fuck
So I'ma turn it around[30]
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound[30]
(Gunshot sounds)
Yeah, somethin' like that[31]
But it all depends on the size of the gat[31]
Taking out a police would make my day[32]
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say…[32]

[Hook]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

[Skit 2: Cop, Eazy-E, and Dr. Dre]
(Knocking sounds)
Yeah, man, what you need?
Police, open out!
Aww, shit
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!
(Move, motherfucker, move now!)
What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?
Just shut the fuck up
And get your motherfucking ass on the floor!
(You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?

[Verse 3: Eazy-E & MC Ren]
I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'[33]
Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and[33]
Shining the light in my face, and for what?[34]
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt[34]
I kick ass[35], or maybe ‘cause I blast[35]
On a stupid ass[35] nigga[36] when I'm playing with the trigger[36]
Of an Uzi or an AK[37]
‘Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say[37]
They put out my picture with silence[38]
‘Cause my identity by itself causes violence[38]
The E with the criminal behavior[39]
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor[39]
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?[40]
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot[40]
By me, or another nigga[41]
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger[41]
(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school[42], fool!)[42]
And as you all know, E's here to rule[42]
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror[43]
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a[43]
Dumb motherfucker with a gun[44]
And if I'm rollin' off the 8, he'll be the one[44]
That I take out, and then get away[45]
While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say[45]

[Hook]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

[Skit 3: Dr. Dre, Cop
The verdict:
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck
White bread, chickenshit motherfucker
Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!
Get him out of here!
I want justice!
Get him the fuck out my face!
I want justice!
Out, right now!
Fuck you, you black motherfuckers!

[Hook]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

[[Straight Outta Compton]]
[Intro: Dr. Dre]
You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Straight outta Compton, crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube[1]
From the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes[1]
When I'm called[2] off, I got a sawed[2] -off
Squeeze the trigger and bodies are hauled[2] off
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm going[3] out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing[3] out
Niggas start to mumble[4], they wanna rumble[4]
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo[4]
Going off on the motherfucker like that[5]
With a gat[5] that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth[6]
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move[6]
Here's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'[7]
With a crime record like Charles Manson[7]
AK-47 is the tool[8]
Don't make me act a motherfucking fool[8]
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe[9]
I'm knocking niggas out the box, daily[9]
Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly[10]
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly[10]
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T[11]
Boy, you can't fuck with me[11]
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck[12]
‘Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck[12]
As I leave, believe I'm stompin'[13]
But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton[13]
(Compton Compton Compton)

[Interlude: Eazy E (MC Ren)]
Yo, Ren! (Whassup?)
Tell 'em where you from!

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Straight outta Compton, another crazy ass nigga[14]
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger[14]
I'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this
But the pussy-ass niggas won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps[15]
If not from the records, from jacking or craps[15]
Just like burglary, the definition is jacking[16]
And when I'm legally armed it's called packing[16]
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute[17]
I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it[17]
So if you're at a show[18] in the front row[18]
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho[18]
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're composed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit[19], ‘cause I'm tearing up shit[19]
MC Ren controls the automatic[20]
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static[20]
Not the right hand, ‘cause I'm the hand itself[21]
Every time I pull an AK off the shelf[21]
The security is maximum, and that's a law[22]
R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw[22]
See, ‘cause I'm the motherfucking villain[23]
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'[23]
That's taking place without a clue[24]
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through[24]
Look, you might take it as a trip[25]
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip[25]
Straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(Straight outta Compton)

[Interlude: Dr. Dre]
Eazy is his name, and the boy is coming…

[Verse 3: Eazy E]
…Straight outta Compton
Is a brother[26] that'll smother[26] your mother[26]
And make your sister think I love her[26]
Dangerous motherfucker[26] raising hell[27]
And if I ever get caught, I make bail[27]
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem[28]
I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him[28]
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while[29]
And when I see a punk pass, I smile[29]
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving
But don't know where the fuck he's going[30], just rolling[30]
Looking for the one they call Eazy[31]
But here's a flash, they'll never seize me[31]
Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark[32]
Except when I unload
You see a spark[32] and jump over hesitation[33]
And hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration[33]
Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting[34]
But leave a memory no one'll be forgetting[34]
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her![35]
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker[35]
This is an autobiography of the E[36]
And if you ever fuck with me[36]
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother[37]
Word to the motherfucker[37], straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(Straight outta Compton)

[Outro]
Damn, that shit was dope!

[[Gangsta Gangsta]]
[Skit: Krazy D + Eazy-E (Dr. Dre)]
*Sirens*
Ah shit. Man, them pinche black gangstas are at it again
I wonder who they fucked up today?
*Screeching Tires*
You, motherfucker!
*Machine Gun Fire*
(Got him)

[Police + MC Ren]
Pull over to the side right now
Man fuck them motherfuckers

[Intro: Eazy-E + Sample]
Yo Dre! Give me a funky ass bassline!
Right here!

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Here's a little something bout[46] a nigga like me[1]
Never should have been let out[46] the penitentiary[1]
Ice Cube would like to say[2]
That I'm a crazy mothafucka from around the way[2]
Since I was a youth, I smoked weed out[3]
Now I'm the muthafucka that you read about[3]
Takin' a life or two[4] that's what the hell I do[4]
You don't like how I'm living, well fuck you[4]
This is a gang, and I'm in it[5]
My man Dre'll fuck you up in a minute[5]
With a right left, right, left you toothless[6]
And then you say: "Goddamn they ruthless"[6]
Everywhere we go they say, "damn"[7]
N.W.A's fucking up the program[7]
And then you realize we don't care[8]
We don’t just say no, we’re too busy saying, "yeah"[8]
About drinkin' straight out the eight bottle[9]
Do I look like a muthafuckin' role model[9]
To a kid looking up to me[10]
Life ain't nothing but bitches and money[10]
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last[11]
If you fuck with me I’ll put my foot in your ass[11]
See I don't give a fuck cause I keep bailing[12]
Yo, what the fuck are they yelling[12]

[Chorus: MC Ren + Sample]
Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yelling
It's not about a salary[13], it's all about reality[13]
Gangsta, Gangsta!
Hoping you sophisticated motherfuckers hear what I have to say

[Verse 2: Ice Cube + MC Ren]
When me and my posse stepped in the house[14]
All the punk-ass niggas start breaking out[14]
Cause you know, they know what’s up[15]
So we started lookin' for the bitches with the big butts[15]
Like her, but she keep crying[16]
"I got a boyfriend" - Bitch stop lying[16]
Dumb-ass hooker ain't nothing but a dyke[17]
Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like[17]
Walked over to em, and said what's up
The first nigga that I saw[18], hit em in the jaw[18]
Ren started stomping em, and so did E[19]
By that time got rushed by security[19]
Out the door, but we don't quit[20]
Ren said, "Let's start some shit"[20]
I got a shotgun, and here's the plot[21]
Taking niggas out with a flurry of buck shots[21]
Boom, boom, boom, yeah I was gunning[22]
And then you look, all you see is niggas running[22]
And falling and yellin', and pushin', and screaming
And cussin[23], I stepped back, and I kept busting[23]
And then I realized it's time for me to go[24]
So I stopped, jumped in the vehicle[24]
It's like this, because of that who-ride[25]
N.W.A. is wanted for a homicide[25]
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
Fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
See I don't give a fuck, cause I keep bailing
Yo, what the fuck are they yelling

[Chorus: MC Ren + Sample]
Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yelling
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta, Gangsta
He'll tell you exactly how he feel, and don't want a fucking thing back

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Homies all standing around, just hanging[26]
Some dope-dealing, some gang-banging[26]
We decide to roll and we deep[27]
See a nigga on Dayton's and we creep[27]
Real slow[28] and before you know[28]
I had my shotgun pointed in the window[28]
He got scared, and hit the gas[29]
Right then, I knew I has to smoke his ass[29]
He kept rolling, I jumped in the bucket[30]
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it[30]
Then we headed right back to the fort[31]
Sweating all the bitches in the biker shorts[31]
We didn't get no play from the ladies[32]
With six niggas in a car are you crazy[32]
She was scared, and it was showing[33]
We all said "fuck you bitch" and kept going[33]
To the hood, and we was fin to[34]
Find something else to get into[34]
Like some pussy, or in fact[35]
A bum rush, but we call it rat pack[35]
On a nigga for nothing at all[36]
Ice Cube'll go stupid when I'm full of eight ball[36]
I might stumble, but still won't lose[37]
Now I'm dressed in the county blues[37]
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck, cause I keep bailing
Yo, what the fuck are they yelling

[Interlude: Dr. Dre + MC Ren (The Jimmy Castor Bunch)]
Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit
Man what'cha gon' do now?
(What we're gonna do right here is go way back)
How far you going back?
(Way back)
"As we go a lil' somethin like this"
Hit it

[Ice Cube]
Here's a lil gangsta, short in size[38]
A t-shirt and Levis[38] is his only disguise[38]
Built like a tank yet hard to hit[39]
Ice Cube and Eazy-E cold running shit[39]

[Verse 4: Eazy-E + MC Ren]
Well I'm Eazy-E the one they're talking about[40]
Nigga tried to roll the dice and just crapped out[40]
Police tried to roll, so it's time to go[41]
I creeped away real slow[41] and jumped in the six-fo'[41]
With the: Diamond in the back, sun-roof top
Digging the scene[42] with the gangsta lean[42]
Cause I'm the E, I don't slang[43] or bang[43]
I just smoke motherfuckers like it ain't[43] no thang[43]
And all you bitches, you know I'm talking to you[44]
We want to fuck you Eazy
I want to fuck you too[44]
Because you see, I don’t really take no shit[45]
So let me tell you motherfuckers who you're fucking with[45]
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck, cause I keep bailing
Yo, what the fuck are they yelling

[Chorus: MC Ren + Sample]
Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yelling
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta, Gangsta
He'll fuck up you and yours, and anything that gets in his way
Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yelling
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta, Gangsta
He'll just call you a low-life motherfucker and talk about your funky ways

[[Express Yourself]]
[Intro]
Dr. Dre: Yo, man, it's a lot of brothers out there flakin' and perpetratin' but scared to kick reality
Ice Cube: Man, you've been doin' all this dope producing, but you ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is
Dr. Dre: So what you want me to do? ... (Express yourself)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I'm expressing with my full capabilities[1]
And now I'm living in correctional facilities[1]
Cause some don't agree with how I do this[2]
I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist[2]
I'm dropping flavor[3], my behavior[3] is hereditary[4]
But my technique is very necessary[4]
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate[5]
Add it on a dope beat and that'll make you think[5]
Some suckers just tickle me pink[5]
To my stomach, cause they don't flow like this[6] one
You know what? I won't hesitate to dis[6] one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this[7]
Some drop science, well I'm dropping English[7]
Even if Yella[8] makes it a cappella[8]
I still express[9], yo I don't smoke weed or sess[9]
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage[10]
And brain damage[10] on the mic don't manage[10] nothing
But making a sucker and you equal[11], don't be another sequel[11]

[Hook]
Express yourself
Come on and do it

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Now, getting back to the PG[12]
That's program, and it's easy[12]
Dre is back[14], new jacks[14] are made hollow[13]
Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow[13]
The words, the style, the trend[15], the records I spin[15]
Again[15] and again[15] and again[15], yo, you on the other end[15]
Watch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help[16]
There's no fessing[17] and guessing[17] while I'm expressing[17] myself[16]
It's crazy to see[18] people be[18]
What society[18] wants them to be[18], but not me[18]
Ruthless is the way to go[19], they know[19]
Others say rhymes that fail to be original[19]
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts[20]
Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts[20]
Some musicians curse at home[21]
But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone[21]
Yeah, they want reality but you won't hear none[22]
They rather exaggerate a little fiction[22]
Some say no to drugs and take a stand[23]
But after the show they go looking for the dopeman[23]
Or they ban my group from the radio[24], hear N.W.A and say "Hell no!"[24]
But you know it ain't all about wealth[25] as long as you make a note to...

[Hook]
Express yourself[25]
Come on and do it

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
From the heart[26] cause if you wanna start[26] to move up the chart[26]
Then expression is a big part[26] of it
You ain't efficient when you flow
You ain't swift, moving like a tortoise[27], full of rigor mortis[27]
There's a little bit more to show[28]
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo[28]
Or a lesson[29], all of 'em expression[29]
And if you start fessing[29], I got a Smith and Wesson[29] for you
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom[30]
I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn[30]
It's Dre on the mic, getting physical
Doing the job[31], N.W.A is the lynch mob[31]
Yes, I'm macabre[31] but you know you need this[32]
And the knowledge is growing, just like a fetus[32]
Or a tumor[33] but here's the rumor[33]
Dre is in the neighborhood[34] and he's up to no good[34]
When I start expressing myself, Yella slam it[35]
Cause If I stay funky like this, I'm doing damage[35]
Or I'mma be too hyped and need a straight jacket[36]
I got knowledge and other suckers lack it[36]
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic[37]
Ask what it's like[37], it's like[37] we getting hype[37] tonight[37]
Cause if I strike[37], it ain't for your good health[38]
But I won't strike[37] if you just

[Hook]
Express yourself[38]
Come on and do it

[[Dopeman]]
[Introduction: Eazy-E and unknown Dopefiend]
[Dopefiend] *knocking on the door*
[Eazy-E] Yo man what you need?
[Dopefiend] Yo, uh, man I need something man, I need a twenty, man
[Eazy-E] Whatchu got, man?
[Dopefiend] Ey, I got this rope chain, man
[Eazy-E] Man, this shit look like a gold on the roll shit (What the fuck is that?)
(It's a fuckin dud!)
[Dopefiend] It's real man
[Eazy-E] This shit ain't real
(That nigga seein' that shit again, man?!)
[Eazy-E] Get the fuck outta here and come back with some money
[Dopefiend] C'mon man, be cool man
[Eazy-E] Y'all Mexicans always comin' with this shit

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
It was once said by a man who couldn't quit[1]
"Dopeman, please can I have another hit?"[1]
The dope man said, "Clucka, I don't give a shit[1]
If your girl kneel down and sucked my dick"[1]
It all happened and the guy tried to choke her[2]
Nigga didn't care, she ain't nothing but a smoker[2]
That's the way it goes, that's the name of the game[3]
Young brother getting over by slanging caine[3]
Gold around his neck in 14 k heaven[4]
Bitches jocking on his dick 24-7[4]
Plus he's making money keeping the base heads waiting[5]
Rollin 6.4. with the fresh ass daytons[5]
Living in Compton, California CA[6]
His Uzi up yo ass if he don't get paid[6]
Nigga begging for credit, he's knocking out teeth[7]
Clocking much dollars on the 1st and 15th[7]
Big wad of money, nothing less than a twenty[8]
Yo, you want a five-oh? The dope man's got plenty[8]
To be a dope man, boy, you must qualify[9]
Don't get high[9] off your own supply[9]
From a key[10] to a g[10] it's all about money[10]
10 piece for 10 base, pipe comes free[10]
And people out there are not hip to the fact[11]
If you see someboy getting money for crack[11], he's the

[Hook]
Dopeman, dopeman!
Hey man give me a hit[12]
Dopeman, dopeman!
Yo man fuck that shit[12]
Dopeman, dopeman!
We just can't quit[12]
Dopeman, dopeman!
Well, suck this bitch![12]

[Interlude: Dr. Dre]
Wait a minute -- who the fuck are you talking to?
Do you know who the fuck I am?
Man, I can't believe this shit -- this bitch is trying to gank me
I'll slap you up side your head with nine inches of limp dick!

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
You need a nigga with money so you get a dopeman[13]
Juice that fool for as much as you can[13]
She likes his car and he gets with[14] her
Got a black eye cause the dopeman hit[14] her
Let that slide and you pay it no mind[15]
Find that he's slapping you all the time[15]
But that's okay, cause he's so rich[16]
And you ain't nothing but a dopeman's bitch![16]
Do what he say and you keep your mouth shut[17]
Popping that trash might get you fucked up[17]
You'll sit and cry if the dope man strikes[18] you
He don't give a fuck -- he got two just like[18] you
There's a another girl in the dopeman's life[19]
Not quite a bitch but far from a wife[19]
Shes called the strawberry and everybody know[20]
Strawberry, strawberry is the neighborhood ho[20]
Do anything for a hit or two[21]
Give tha bitch a rock, she'll fuck the whole damn crew[21]
It might be your wife and it might make you sick[22]
Come home and see her mouth on the dopeman's dick[22]
Strawberry just look and you'll see her[23]
But don't fuck around or she'll give you gonorrhea[23]
And people out there are not hip to the fact[24]
That Strawberry is a girl selling pussy for crack[24] to the

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
If you smoke 'caine, you're a stupid motherfucker[25]
Known around the hood as the schoolyard clucker[25]
Doing that crack with all the money you got[26]
On your hands and knees searching for a piece of rock[26]
Jonesing for a hit and you're looking for more[27]

Knucklehead nigga, yeah, you turned into a crook[29]
But swear up and down, boy, that you ain't hooked[29]
You beat your friend up and you whooped his ass long[30]
Cause he hit the pipe till the rock was all gone[30]
You're robbing and stealing[31], bugging and illing[32]
While the dope man's dealing[31]
What is killing[32] your pain,[33] cocaine,[33] this shit's insane[33]
Yo, E, she's a berry lets run a train[33]

[Eazy-E]
Man, I wouldn't touch that bitch

[Ice Cube]
Me neither;[34] Ho, go home and wash out your beaver[34]

Yo, got that five-0 -- double up, nigga[36]

[[A Bitch Iz a Bitch]]
[Narrator]
Let's describe a certain female
A female with a disease of character and attitude
If you will a snob
However in the view of NWA...

[Ice Cube]
A bitch[1] is a bitch[1]
So if I'm poor or rich[1]
I talk in the exact same pitch[2]
Now the title bitch don't apply to all women[2]
But all women have a little bitch in 'em[2]
It's like a disease that plagues their character[3]
Taking the women of America[3]
And it starts with the letter[4] B[5]
It makes a girl like that think she better[4] than me[5]
See, some get mad and some just bear[6] it
But, yo, if the shoe fits wear[6] it
It makes 'em go deaf in the ear that's why[7]
When you say 'hi' she won't say 'hi'[7]
Are you the kind that think you're too damn fly?[7]
Bitch eat shit and die[7]
Ice Cube coming at you at a crazy pitch[8]
(Why?) I think a bitch[8] is a bitch[8]

[Girl]
Who the fuck you think you calling a bitch you little sorry motherfucker
I don't know who the fuck you think you talking to
Let me tell you one motherfucking thing, I'm not no-
"Bitch, shut the fuck up"

[Ice Cube]
Yo, you can tell a girl that's out for the money[9]
She look good and the bitch walk funny[9]
She ain't no dummy[9], she's rather conniving[10]
Yo bitch, fuck what I'm driving[10]
See a young nigga that's striving[10]
You're through[11] without a BMW[11]
That's why a bitch is a bitch I guess[12]
Or either P-M-S[12]
Here, test the girl that's kinda snobby[13]
And I bet you dissing niggas is her hobby[13]
And after she finished the test
Grade today of B-I-T-C-H
And watch her get mad cause she know it's true[14] (She know it)
But a nigga like me'll say "fuck you"[14]
Do like Ice Cube, slam her ass in a ditch[15] (word)
Cause a bitch[15] is a bitch[15]

[Girl/Ice Cube]
"Why I gotta be a bitch?"
I ain't call you no bitch, if you listen to the goddamn song it'd tell you what a bitch is...
"Fuck the song cause I'm not no motherfucking bitch"
I didn't say you was a bitch, if you stop acting like a goddamn bitch
"Fuck you, little punk-ass little nigga"
Fuck you, bitch! You sloppy-ass, scandalous-ass ho!
"Fuck you! Who the fuck you think you are?"
Fuck you! Suck my dick, bitch! You scandalous-ass, doo-doo dog breath, stinking, ugly...

[Ice Cube]
I once knew a bitch who got slapped[16]
Cause she played me like she was all that[16]
A bitch can be your best friend talking behind your back[16]
About who's fucking who and who's getting fat[16]
Look at yourself for me[17] (Look, bitch)
Now do you fall in this category?[17]
Or you the kind that won't blink[18]
Cause you don't think your shit stink[18]
Lucky I haven't had a drink[18]
Cause I'd down[19] your ass
Then I'd clown[19] your ass
Cause the niggas I hang with ain't rich[20]
We'll all say "Fuck you bitch!"[20]
Now what can I do with a ho like you[21]
Bend your ass over and then I'm through[21]
Cause you see Ice Cube ain't taking no shit[22]
(Why?) Cause I think a bitch[22] is a bitch[22]

[Narrator]
There you have it, the description of a bitch
Now ask yourself are they talking about you?
Are you that funky, dirty, money-hungry, scandalous, stuck-up, hair piece contact wearing bitch?
Yep, you probably are

Bitch!

[[Real Niggaz]]
[Intro: Dr. Dre + Laylaw]
Yo, what’s up niggas and niggettes?
N.W.A is back in this motherfucker
And this is only the single
Wait until the motherfucking album comes out
We gone have some more of that good shit
The shit you just can’t fuck with
But yo, we ain’t finished, tell ‘em what’s up man
Yo man, there’s a gang of motherfuckers out there on the dick, man
In every motherfuckin' state
Wanna be like, wanna look like, wanna act like
Wanna dress like, wanna sound like muthafuckin' style stealin'
Clone ass N.W.A bitin' ass motherfuckin' everywhere man
Non-reality seein', non-reality feelin'
Non-reality livin' ass motherfuckers man
Hey, I don’t know, reality, it’s important to me, man
So fellas man, tell these niggas what it’s like in the minds of real niggas

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Prisoner like a hostage[1]
Yo, you should of covered your muthafucking head like an ostrich[1]
Deep in the dirt cause you's a sucker[2]
And you ass up high so I can kick the muthafucker[2]
Don’t try to hang, you best avoid[3]
Cause my foot will be so far up your ass you’ll get hemorrhoids[3]
Before you try to fuck wit Ren[4]
I'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting a size 10[4]

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
First come, first serve[5], whoever's got the nerve[5]
Step up and get what you deserve[5]
From the word[5] of a muthafucking hip-hop maniac[6]
Brainiac[6], so what you oughta do is step the fuck back[6]
Now how the fuck you think a rap will last?[7]
Wit your ass saying shit that is said in the past[7]
Yo, be original, your shit is sloppy[8]
Get off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy[8]

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
Falling deep in the drums so many of styles[9]
Is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles[9]
Cheating[10] and now beating[10], the crowd I kept seating[10]
But weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating[10]
Styles that kept them full of bull[11]
Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full[11]
They got the nerve to cuss[12]
Only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us[12]

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Yo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do[13]
You don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you[13]
You can't harm[14] me[15], alarm[14] me[15]
Cause we're the generals in this fucking hip-hop army[15]
The niggas wit attitudes if you didn't know[16]
We blow[16], flow[16] and getting loose slow[16] from the get go[16], yo[16]
Try us and take[17] it[18]
Yo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break[17] in[18]

[Hook]
It's the real thing, you are now real, real niggas, niggas

[Verse 5: MC Ren]
You can run, but you can’t hide, you know I'mma find[19] 'cha
Cause a nigga like Ren's only 2 steps behind[19] 'cha
Don’t look back because you’re shaking and all scared[20]
A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare[20]
So sleep wit the lights[21] on, forget that the mic's[21] on
Don't step on my muthafucking stage without nike's[21] on
Don’t say it’s psycho[22] and then you just might[23] go[22]
Mentally fucked up when I let the right[23] blow[22]

[Verse 6: Dr. Dre]
All these niggas wit the jibber jabber[24]
But couldn't kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer[24]
Gangstas in black are out there[25]
But only because, yo, it’s the shit that we wear[25]
On my muthafucking dick[26]
But I'mma love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick[26]
So, yo, step off, go to bed, cause if you're mislead[27]
You get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead[27]

[Verse 7: Eazy-E + MC Ren ]
Black, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see[28]
A little streetwise nigga, you know me[28]
Rolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps[29]
But you muthafuckas know who run the streets[29]
Wit that hardcore hip-hop rap shit[30]
Now how much harder can another nigga get?[30]
Trying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us[31]
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust[31]
So nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please[32]
Since you're on the dick why don't you drop to your knees[32]
Cause I'm a muthafucka that's out to kill[33]
Eazy-E, a nigga that's real[33]

[Interlude: DJ Yella]
Real niggas, straight off the streets of Compton
Quick to get in your shit without second thought[34]
And if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught[34]
So if you're talking shit about the niggas in black[35]
Bow down to the Kings in Raider hats[35]

[Verse 8: MC Ren]
They played out, that's what niggas were chanting[36]
One nigga left and they said we ain't happening[36]
People had thought we was finished and then done wit[37]
But if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit[37]
Yet, so cover your ears[38] and wipe your tears[38]
And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas[38]
And when the new record comes, I’ll come like a fucking bomb[39]
Asking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb[39]
You're on the dicks of four niggas not one
And when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one
So brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked[40] up
Cause if I let you slide, it’s just cause you lucked[40] up
Don’t come in my face again, because I'mma floor[41] ya
And if you're a bitch, I'm a fucking ignore[41] ya
Because my attitude's a little bigga[42]
Cause MC Ren is one of the real niggas[42]

[Verse 9: Dr. Dre]
Lost in a muthafucking world of madness[43]
Sadness[43], but Dre is just a nigga that gladdest[43]
Sucking muthafuckas like you, making wack jams[44]
Because it only shows you how dope I am[44]
Never try to ignore us[45]
When I'm expressing, stand still like you're full of rigor mortis[45]
Cause I'm a real nigga[46], but I guess you figure[46]
You can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger[46]
Dre is just a nigga with heart[47], a nigga that’s smart[47]
A nigga that’s paid to say[48] what others are scared to play[48]
We started out wit too much cargo[49]
So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold[49]
Yo, N.W.A,[50] criticize for what we say[50]
But I'm a do the shit anyway[50]
Cause I'm the muthafucking doctor, never faking[51]
Yo, Yella, kick the muthafucking break in[51]

[Outro: MC Ren]
N.W.A, straight outta muthafucking Compton
Taking over shit in all of the 1990's
Yo, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, Eazy-E
And I am MC Ren, yo, N.W.A taking over this muthafucka y'all

[[Chin Check]]
[Ice Cube]

[Dr. Dre]
You tell me, you talk to Ren

[MC Ren]

I'm a nigga wit an attitude thanks to y'all
And I don't give a fuck I keep it gangsta y'all
I'mma ride[1] for my side[1] in the C.P.T[2]
God bless the memory[2] of Eazy-E[2]
If it wasn't for me[2] where the fuck you'd be[2]
Rapping like the Treacherous Three[2], fucking cowards[3]
I'd have seen Dre rocking parties for hours[3]
And I'd have seen Ren fucking bitches from Howard[3]
And I'd have seen Snoop give away Eddie Bauer's[3]
So fuck Jerry Heller and the white superpowers[3]

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
This the shit niggas kill for
They hear the villain niggas spitting with them nigga flows[4]
Fuck you hoes[4], fuck you bitch-ass niggas too
Got something for you broke[5]
These niggas wearing skirts like the pope[5]
Who them niggas that you love to get[6]
Who them niggas that you fuckin' with[6]
Love to yell to yell that we the shit[6]
The saga continues with the world's most dangerous group[7]
Four deep in the coup[7]

I'mma choke[8] who I wanna choke, fuck that
I'mma ride where I wanna ride, fuck that
Cause I'mma nigga for life, so I'mma nigga til I diz-ie

I'mma choke who I wanna choke, fuck that
I'mma ride where I wanna ride, fuck that
Cause I'mma nigga for life, so I'mma nigga til I diz-ie

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
A pencil, a pen, or a Glock

Titanium,[9] criminal[8] minded, swift[10]
D-R-E with that fuck a bitch shit[10]
A couple of notes[11] and get you hog-tied in rope[11]
Dope[11] like tons of coke[11], cut-throat[11]
You don't want the pistols[12] to whistle[12]
Candy paint Impala[13]

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
God damn hoes, here we go again[14]
Fucking with Ren,[14] playing to win[14]
He got the Coke and Hen[14] - I got the juice and gin[14]
Same shit you was fucking with way back then[14]
We keep it cracking[15] from the acting[15] to the jacking[15]
G'ed[16] up C'ed[16] up motherfucker blaze the weed[16] up
We all on deck fool so put your heat[16] up
I stay on deck[17] so me don't get wet[17]

[Ice Cube]
Look my nigga, we can scatter like buckshots[18]
Let's get together, make a record, why the fuck not[18]

[MC Ren]
Why the fuck not

[Dr. Dre]
Why the fuck not

[Snoop Dogg]
Why the fuck not

[Ice Cube]
Cause I'm tight[19] as the night[19]
I had to wipe[19] activator off the mic,[19] in 1985

[Snoop Dogg]
Real niggas, biatch, you know, ha hah

[Ice Cube]
We cause tragedy[20], erratically[20]
Systematically[20] in your house without a key[20]
How fucked up that'd be[20]
Gat'll be[20] near your anatomy,[20] my form of flattery[20]

[Dr. Dre]
Assault and battery,[20] cause we coming with that street mentality[20]
Straight west coast rider academy[20]
Concrete nigga, that's my reality[20]

[Snoop Dogg]
We tend to bust on niggas that get mad at me[20]

[Dr. Dre]
Was it a bitch[21] in the mix[21]

[Snoop Dogg]
Well it had to be[20]

[Dr. Dre]
Lying tricks[21] told them dicks[21] I had a key[20]
Hoes make the world harder than it have to be[20]

[Refrain]
I'mma smoke where I wanna smoke, fuck that

Cause I'mma nigga for life, so I'mma nigga til I diz-ie

[[100 Miles and Runnin']]
[Intro: FBI + MC Ren]
Catch those motherfuckers, catch them, catch them
Hey man, keep up keep up, this way, come on man, hurry up
You don't really think you're gonna get away, do you?
We haven't spotted them yet. But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
A 100 Miles and Runnin'[1] - MC Ren, I hold the gun[2] and[1]
You want me to kill a mutherfucker and it's done[2] in[1]
Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct[40] -
Is one of the main reasons I don't give a fuck[40]
Chances are usually not good[3]
Cause I'm frisked with my hands on a hot hood[3]
And gettin' jacked by the you-know-who[4]
When in a black and white the capacity is two[4]
We're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers[5]
Not wearing medallions, cause we're not stupid, mutherfuckers[5]
They're out to take our heads for what we said in the past[6]
Point blank, they can kiss my black ass[6]
I didn't stutter when I said "Fuck Tha Police"[7]
Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace[7]
Now it's broken and can't be fixed[8]
Cause police and little black niggers don't mix[8] so
Now I'm creepin' through the fall[9]
Runnin' like a team, we'll see, I might have slayed y'all[9]
So for now pack the gun and[10]
Hold it in the air cause MC Ren has a 100 Miles of Runnin'[10]

[Interlude]
Into this news. Four fugitives are on the run
FBI sources tell us that the four are headed
100 miles to their homebase, Compton

[Break: Dr. Dre + Eazy-E]
Lend me a mutherfuckin' ear
So I can tell you why

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Runnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase[11]
With a steady pace[11] on the face[11] that just we raced[11]
The road ahead goes on and on[12]
The shit is gettin' longer than the mutherfuckin' marathon[12]
Runnin' on but never runnin' out
Stayin' wired[13] and if I get tired,[13] I can still try out
Hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do[14]
But nobody's pickin' up a Nigga Witta Attitude[14]
Confused,[15] yo but Dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose[15]
One of the few who's been accused[15] and abused[15]
Of the crime[16] of poisonin' young minds[16]
But you don't know shit til you been in my shoes[15]
And Dre is back from the C-P-T[17]
Droppin' some shit that's D-O-P-E[17]
So fuck the P-O-L-I-C-E![17]
And any mutherfucker that d[17]isagrees
Stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass[18]
Cause I been a nigga known for havin' a notorious past[18]
My mind was slick[19] - my temper was too quick[19]
Now the FBI's all over my dick[19]

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Got the stick[19] and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock[20]
That's when the E jumped off the startin' block[20]
A 100 Miles from home and ,yo, it's a long stretch[21]
A little sprintin' mutherfucker that they won't catch[21]
Yeah, back to Compton again[22]
Yo, it's either that or the Federal pen[22]
Cause niggas been runnin' since beginning of time[23]
Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my mutherfuckin' mind[23]
Runnin' like I just don't care[24]
Compton's 50 miles but , yo, I'mma get there[24]
Archin' my back and on a straight rough
Just like Carl Lewis I'm ballin' the fuck out
From city to city I'm a menace as I pass by[25]
Rippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm[25]
A straight up nigga that's done in[26], gunnin'[26] and comin'[26]
Straight at yo ass, 100 Miles and Runnin'[26]

[Interlude]
This one goes out to the four brothers from Compton
You're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you:
Nowhere to run to, baby. Nowhere to hide
Good luck brothers

[Verse 4: MC Ren]
Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose[27]
Show me on the news[27] but I hate to be abused[27]
I know it was a set[28] -up - So now I'm gonna get up[28]
Even if the FBI wants me to shut up
But I've got 10 000 niggas strong[29]
They got everybody singin' my "Fuck Tha Police" song[29]
And while they treat my group like dirt[30]
Their whole fuckin' family is wearin' our T-shirts[30]
So I'mma run til I can't run no more[31]
Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score[31]
I got a urge to kick down doors[31]
At my grave[32] like a slave[32] even if the Ren calls

[Verse 5: Dr. Dre]
Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'[33]
Dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'[33]
Started with five and, yo, one couldn't take[34] it
So now there's four cause the fifth couldn't make[34] it
The number's even[35] - now I'm leavin'[35]
We're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in[35]
Her and the troops are right behind[36] me
But they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find[36] me

[Verse 6: Eazy-E]
One more mile to go through the dark streets[37]
Runnin' like a mutherfucker on my own two feet[37]
But you know I never stumble or lag last[38]
I'm almost home so I better haul ass[38]
Tearin' up everything in sight[39]
It's a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight[39]
Now that chase, the shit, is done and
Four mutherfuckers goin' crazy with
A 100 Miles of Runnin'!

Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Surprise, niggas!

[[Appetite for Destruction]]
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I got a taste[1] for waste[1] and a taste and a blood[3]
Murder[2] I heard her[2] when she screamed the "Drop!"
Cause her son caught the slug[3]
Relate this to no choice[4]
And listen to this straight-up man[5] before they ban[5] the voice[4]
While I rhyme to the rhythm of a pop[6]
Remember the first nigga that runs is the first to get shot[6]
Whoever said that what I say[9] and portray[9] is negativity[7]
Need to come kick it in the city[7] with me[7]
And find the black[8] and crack[8] de fact[8]
And take that shit back[8] cuz they don't wanna fuck with that[8]
There's too many niggas they're tryin' to calm
If mothafuckaz could get it[], nobody would've fuck with it
Appetite for destruction, for him to get a bit[10] more shit[10] -
He gotta commit[10] murder in the first degree and manslaughter[11]
Taking the life of his wife and young daughter[11]
A whole city of bitches, that look sucked[12] up
And the niggas is killin', it's straight fucked[12] up
Whoever sayin', what I'm sayin's for greed[13]
The 9 even when they're tryin' to feed[13]
My appetite for destruction

" .. you guys know who I'm talkin' to .. "

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
The appetite is tremendous[14] - so I'm gonna spin this[14]
Drop up some violence because they ax me to end this
Some trouble that I cought cuz I was noisy[15]
A nigga tried to take advantage because of the kamikaze[15]
He took a swing for my head - thought I was faded[16]
Start runnin' for the door but the fucker never made it[16]
The sound of the 9 went bang[17]
And all over the wall was his mothafuckin' brain[17]
Cause I'm a nigga you can't sleep on[18]
So set the alarm,[18] cause I hit like a mothafuckin' bomb[18]
I do damage with the 9 in my hand[19]
But the average nigga that don’t know me don’t understand[19]
I'm from the streets so therefore,[20] you know I don't care for[20]
A sucker that ain't down with the real niggas the niggas the niggas
Yo, and after when the shit gotta go ain't even sober
Any time that the 9 wanna leave[21]
I got a .38 hidden up the sleeve[21]
And it's ready to go to war cuz that's what it's here for[22]
I shoot down a million niggas and shoot one more[22]
And that's the million and one, they couldn't hang with the appetite[23]
Cause they wasn't rappin' right[23]
So I had to destroy whoever was standin' in my presence[24]
For fuckin' up the essence[24] - appetite for destruction

[Interlude]
"Cops put a hurtin' on your ass, man, you know
They really degrade you
White folks don't believe that shit, they don't believe that cops degrade you
[Imitating white person] Oh come on, those people, those people are resisting arrest."

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Check it out y'all, in the house y'all
So I can show[25] and flow[25] and let the people know[25]
So won't you ease on down to the yellow brick road to Compton[26]
But first let me tell you somethin'[26] -
I possess to 10 commandments of the Hip Hop thugsta
Known as the thief and murderer :
First one - honor thy nigga with an attitude
Gotta get respect[27] or break your mothafuckin' neck[27]
Second one - always gotta fuck out of wedlock[28]
I like it when the pussy goes snap, crackle and pop[28]
Number three - I'm a gangsta fanatic[29]
I smoke any foolz tryin' to cause some static[29]
Number four[30] - here's what's in store[30]
A crazy ass nigga that remains hardcore[30]
Fifth one[31] - my kill has just begun[31]
I pull out my gun[31] that will keep me on the run[31]
Step six - hmmm, it's kinda tricky -
Can't forget that I'm mothafuckin' chickenshit
To the ones who tries to play the E[32] -
By the time you reach Seven you'll be 6 feet deep[32]
Number eight - make no mistake
Move real sneaky and you're bound to catch your prey
Ninth one - I gotta be raw,[33] fuck any brainwashing man-made law[33]
Last but not least, I must be real -
Number ten - is my appetite to ki ...
