[Produced by RZA]

[Intro: Raekwon + Method Man]
What that nigga want, God?
Word up, look out for the cops though
Wu-Tang five finger shit
Cash rules-
Word up, two for fives over here, baby
Word up, two for fives, niggas got garbage down the way, word up, know what I'm sayin'?
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. get-
Yeah, check this old fly shit out, word up
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M.
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all
Take you on a natural joint
Here we here we go, check this shit, yo

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
I grew up on the crime[1] side, the New York Times[1] side
Stayin' alive[2] was no jive[2]
Had secondhands,[3] Mom's bounced on old man[3]
So then we moved to Shaolin land[3]
A young youth,[4] yo, rockin' the gold tooth,[4] 'Lo goose[4]
Only way I be gettin' the G off was drug loot[4]
And let's start it like this, son[5]
Rollin' with this one and that one[5]
Pullin' out gats for fun[5]
But it was just a dream[6] for the teen[6] who was a fiend[6]
Started smokin' woolas at 16[6]
And runnin' up in gates,[7] and doin' hits for high stakes[7]
Makin' my way on fire escapes[7]
No question I would speed[8] for cracks and weed[8]
The combination made my eyes bleed[8]
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Stickin' up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better,[9] same damn 'Lo sweater[9]
Times is rough and tough like leather[9]
Figured out I went the wrong route[10]
So I got with a sick-ass clique and went all out[10]
Catchin' keys[11] from 'cross seas[11]
Rollin' in MPV's,[11] every week we made forty G's[11]
Yo, nigga, respect mine,[12] or here go the TEC-9[12]
Ch-chick-POW![13] Move from the gate now![13]

[Hook: Method Man]
Cash rules everything around me[14]
C.R.E.A.M., get the money[14]
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
It's been twenty-two long hard years, I'm still strugglin'[15]
Survival[16] got me buggin',[15] but I'm alive on arrival[16]
I peep at the shape of the streets[17]
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep[17]
A man with a dream[18] with plans to make cream[18]
Which failed;[19] I went to jail[19] at the age of fifteen[18]
A young buck sellin' drugs and such,[20] who never had much[20]
Tryin' to get a clutch[20] at what I could not
The court[23] played me short,[23] now I face incarceration[21]
Pacin',[21] goin' upstate's my destination[21]
Handcuffed in the back of a bus,[22] forty of us[22]
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough[22]
But as the world turned I learned life is hell[24]
Livin' in the world no different from a cell[24]
Every day I escape from Jakes givin' chase[25]
Sellin' base,[25] smokin' bones in the staircase[25]
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess[26]
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed[26]
But I'm still depressed, and I ask: what's it worth?[27]
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth[27]
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain[28]
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain[28]
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops,[29] and crack rocks[29]
And stray shots,[29] all on the block that stays hot[29]
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof[30]
To kick the truth[30] to the young black youth[30]
But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer[31]
And ain't tryin' to hear[31] what I'm kickin' in his ear[31]
Neglected[32] for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted[32]
That what? That life is hectic[32]

[Hook: Method Man]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all

[Outro: Inspectah Deck]
Niggas got to do what they got to do
To get through, know what I'm sayin'?
Because you can't just get by no more
Word up, you gotta get over, straight up and down

[Hook: Method Man]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all

[[Da Mystery of Chessboxin']]
[Intro: "Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang" + "Five Deadly Venoms"]
A game of chess is like a swordfight:
You must think first before you move
Toad style is immensely strong
And immune to nearly any weapon
When it's properly used it's almost invincible

[Verse 1: U-God]
Raw I'ma give it to ya,[1] with no trivia[1]
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia[1]
My hip-hop[2] will rock[2] and shock[2] the nation[3]
Like the Emancipation Proclamation[3]
Weak MC's approach with slang that's dead[4]
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head[4]
I'm pushin' force, my force you're doubtin'[5]
I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains[5]

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Well, I'm a sire,[6] I set the microphone on fire[6]
Rap styles vary[7] and carry[7] like Mariah[6]
I come[8] from the Shaolin slum,[8] and the isle I'm from[8]
Is comin' through with nuff niggas and nuff guns[8]
So if you wanna come sweatin',[9] stressin',[9] contestin'[9]
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection[9]
Don't talk the talk[10] if you can't walk the walk[10]
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk[10]
I'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made[11] me
Rebel to the grain, there's no way to barricade[11] me
Steamrollin' niggas like an 18 wheeler
With a drunk driver drivin',[12] there's no survivin'[12]

[Verse 3: Raekwon the Chef]
Rough like Timberland wear,[13] yeah[13]
Me and the Clan in 'Yota Landcruisers out there[13]
Peace to all the crooks,[14] all the niggas with bad looks[14]
Bald heads, braids, blow this hook[14]
We pack chrome TEC's, nickel-plated MAC's[15]
Black AC's,[15] drug-dealin' styles in phat stacks[15]
I only been a good nigga for a minute[16] though[17]
'Cause I got to get my props and win it,[16] yo[17]
I got beef with commercial-ass niggas with gold teeth[18]
Lampin' in a Lexus, eatin' beef[18]
Straight up and down, don't even bother[19]
I got 40 niggas up in here now who kill niggas' fathers[19]

[Hook: Method Man]
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?[20]
In the front, in the back,[20] Killa Bees on attack[20]
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?[20]
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats[20] on the block with the gats[20]

[Verse 4: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Here I go,[21] deep type flow[21]
Jacques Cousteau[21] could never get this low[21]
I'm cherry bombin' shits… BOOM![22]
Just warmin' up a little bit, vroom vroom[22]
Rappinin'[23] is what's happenin'[23]
Keep the pockets stacked and then,[23] hands clap and then[23]
At the party[24] when I move my body[24]
Gotta get up and be somebody![24]
Grab the microphone,[25] put strength to the bone[25]
DUH DUH DUH… enter the Wu-Tang zone[25]
Sure enough[26] when I rock that stuff[26]
Huff?[26] Puff?[26] I'm gonna catch your bluff[26] tuff[26]
Rough,[26] kickin' rhymes like Jim Kelly
Or Alex Haley, I'm a Mi-…Beetle Bailey rhymes
Comin' raw style, hardcore[27]
Niggas be comin' to the hip-hop store[27]
Comin' to buy grocery[28] from me[28]
Tryin' to be a hip-hop MC[28]
The law, in order to enter the Wu-Tang[29]
You must bring[29] the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang[29]
Represent the GZA, Abbot
RZA, Shaquan, Inspectah Deck
Dirty Ol' gettin' low[30] with his flow[30]
Introducin' the Ghostface Killah[31]
No one could get iller[31]

[Hook: Method Man]
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats

[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
Speakin' of the Devil, psych![32]
No, it's the God, get the shit right[32]
Mega trife,[33] and yo, I killed you in a past life[33]
On the mic while you was kickin' that fast shit[34]
You reneged, tried again and got blasted[34]
Half-mastered-ass style, mad ruff task[35]
When I struck I had on Timbs and a black mask[35]
Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack[36]
That night, yo, I was hittin' like a spiked bat[36]
And then you thought I was bugged out, and crazy[37]
Strapped for nonsense, after me became lazy[37]
Yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs[38]
Never shot thugs,[38] I'm runnin' with thugs that flood mugs[38]
So, grab your 8 plus 1[39]
Start flippin'[40] and trippin',[40] niggas is jettin', I'm lickin' off, son[39]

[All]
Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang!

[Verse 6: Masta Killa]
Homicide's illegal and death is the penalty
What justifies[41] the homicide[41] when he dies?[41]
In his own iniquity it's the master[42]
Of the Mantis Rapture[42] comin' at ya[42]
We[46] have an APB[46] on an MC[46] Killer
Looks like the work of a master[43]
Evidence indicates that his stature[43]
Merciless like a terrorist hard to capture[43]
The flow changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system[44]
Disguised like a lie, paralyzin' the victim[44]
You scream[45] as it enters your bloodstream[45]
Erupts your brain[47] from the pain[47] these thoughts contain[47]
Movin' on a nigga with the speed[48] of a centipede[48]
And injure[49] any motherfuckin' contender[49]

[Hook: Method Man]
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats

[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
What y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me
I'm the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
This '97
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine[1]
Let's take it back to '79[1]

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I bomb atomically,[2] Socrates'[2] philosophies[2] and hypotheses[2]
Can't define how I be dropping these[2] mockeries[2]
Lyrically[3] perform armed robbery[3]
Flee with the lottery,[3] possibly they spotted me[3]
Battle-scarred Shogun,[4] explosion[4] when my pen hits tremendous[5]
Ultraviolet shine blind forensics[5]
I inspect you, through the future see millennium[6]
Killer Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum[6]
Shackling[7] the masses with drastic[7] rap tactics[7]
Graphic[7] displays melt the steel like blacksmiths[7]
Black Wu jackets,[7] Queen Bees ease the guns in[8]
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function[8]
Heads by the score[9] take flight incite a war[9]
Chicks hit the floor,[9] die hard fans demand more[9]
Behold[10] the bold[10] soldier, control the globe slowly[11]
Proceeds to blow, swinging swords like Shinobi[11]
Stomp grounds[12] and pound[12] footprints in solid rock[13]
Wu got it locked,[13] performing live on your hottest block[13]

[Verse 2: Method Man]
As the world turns,[14] I spread like germ[14]
Bless the globe with the pestilence[17]
The hard-headed never learn[14]
This my testament[17] to those burned[14]
Play my position in the game of life standing firm[14]
On foreign land[15] jump the gun out the frying pan[15] into the fire[16]
Transform into the Ghost Rider[16]
A six-pack and A Streetcar Named Desire[16]
Who got my back in the line of fire[16] holding back?[18]
What? My peoples if you with me, where the fuck you at?[18]
Niggas is strapped[18] and they're tryna twist my beer cap[18]
It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm[19]
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm[19]
What the blood clot?[20] We smoke pot[20] and blow spots[20]
You want to think twice? I think not[20]
The Iron Lung[22] ain't got to tell you where it's coming from[22]
Guns of Navarone,[21] tearing up your battle zone[21]
Rip through your slums

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
I twist darts[23] from the heart,[23] tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP[26]
Martini[26] on the slang rocks,[24] certified chatterbox[24]
Vocabulary 'Donna talking,[25] tell your story walking[25]
Take cover kid, what? Run for your brother kid
Run for your team and your "six can't rhyme" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme, your fort is basic compared to mine[27]
Domino effect, arts and crafts, paragraphs contain cyanide[27]
Take a free ride on my thought
I got the fashion catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God

[Interlude: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

[Verse 4: U-God]
Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet[28]
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat[28]
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for[29]
Judgment Day cometh, conquer, it's war[29]
Allow us to escape Hell globe spinning bomb[30]
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms[30]
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound[31]
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground[31]
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum[32]
A death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem[32]
Hold it for ransom,[32] tranquilized with anaesthesias[33]
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas[33]
My music Sicily, rich California smell[34]
An axe kill adventure, paint a picture well[34]
I sing a song from Sing-Sing,[35] sipping on ginseng[35]
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring[35] kings[35]

[Verse 5: RZA]
March of the wooden soldiers,[36] C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us[36]
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober[36]
Perpendicular to the square[37] we stay in gold like Flair[37]
Escape from your dragon's lair[37]
In particular my beats travel like a vortex[38]
Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex[38]
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex[38]
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station[39]
Program fat bass lines on Novation[39]
Getting drunk like a fuck, I'm ducking five-year probation[39]

[Verse 6: GZA]
War of the masses,[40] the outcome disastrous[40]
Many of the victim families save their ashes[40]
A million names on walls, engraved in plaques[41]
Those who went back received penalties for their acts[41]
Another heart is torn[42] as close ones mourn[42]
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

[Verse 7: Masta Killa]
The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from[43]
Came one[43] to represent the Nation[43]
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage[44]
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage[44]
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb[45] are mostly intrigued by the drum[45]
Death only one can save self from[45]
This relentless attack of the track spares none[45]

[Verse 8: Ghostface Killah]
Yo Yo Yo, fuck that,[46] look at all these crab niggas laid back[46]
Lamping like them gray and black[46] Puma's on my man's rack[46]
Codeine[47] was forced in your drink, you had a Navy green[47]
Salamander fiend,[47] bitches overheard you scream[47]
You two-faces, scum[48] of the slum,[48] I got your whole body numb[48]
Blowing like Shalamar in '81[48]
Sound convincing,[49] thousand dollar cork-pop convention[49]
Hands like Sonny Liston,[49] get fly permission[49]
Hold the fuck up,[50] I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck[50]
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch[50]
It's me,[51] black Noble Drew Ali[51]
Came in threes[51] we like the Genovese,[51] is that so?
Ceaser needs the greens, it's Earth[52]
Ninety-three million miles from the first[52]
Rough turbulence, the wave burst,[52] split the megahertz[52]

[Verse 9: Raekwon]
Aiyo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk,[53] verbal foul hawk[53]
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk[53]
Swift notarizer,[54] Blue-Tang, all up in the high-riser[54]
New York Yank visor[54] world tranquilizer[54]
Adjust the dosage,[55] delegate my Clan with explosives[55]
While my pen blow lines ferocious[55]
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor,[56] flex the white gold tarantula[56]
Track truck diesel, play the weed God substantiala[56]
Max mostly, undivided then slide in sickening[57]
Guaranteed made 'em jump like Rod Strickland[57]

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I smoke on the mic like "Smokin' Joe" Frazier[1]
The hell-raiser,[1] raisin' hell with the flavor[1]
Terrorize the jam[2] like troops in Pakistan[2]
Swingin' through your town
Like your neighborhood Spider-Man[2]
So uhh, tick tock and keep tickin'[3]
While I get you flippin'[3] off the shit that I'm kickin'[3]
The Lone Ranger,[4] code red: Danger[4]
Deep in the dark[5] with the art[5] to rip the charts[5] apart[5]
The vandal[6] too hot to handle[6]
You battle, you're sayin' goodbye like Tevin Campbell[6]
Roughneck,[8] Inspectah Deck's[8] on the set[8]
The Rebel,[7] I make more noise than heavy metal[7]

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
The way I make the crowd go wild[9]
Sit back, relax, won't smile[9]
Rae got it goin' on, pal
Call me the rap assassinator[10]
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger[10]
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat[11]
Blow up your project,[11] then take all your assets[11]
'Cause I came[12] to shake the frame[12] in half[13]
With the thoughts that bomb shit like Meth[13]
So if you wanna try to flip, go flip on the next man[14]
'Cause I grab the clip and[14]
Hit you with 16 shots and more, I got[15]
Goin' to war with the meltin' pot,[15] akh

[Verse 3: Method Man]
It's the Method Man, for short Mr. Mef[16]
Movin' on your left,[16] UH!
And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat[17]
I wanna break, fool, cock me back[17]
Small change, they puttin' shame[18] in the game[18]
I take aim[18] and blow the nigga out the frame[18]
And like fame,[18] my style will live forever[19]
Niggas crossin' over, but they don't know no better[19]
But I do,[20] true,[20] can I get a "Suuu"?[20]
Nuff respect due[20] to the 1-6-oooh[20]
I mean ohhh,[21] yo,[21] check out the flow[21]
Like the Hudson[22] or PCP when I'm dustin'[22]
Niggas off,[23] because I'm hot like sauce[23]
The smoke from the lyrical blunt make me *cough*

[Interlude: U-God]
Ooh, what, grab my nut, get screwed
Oww, here comes my Shaolin style
True B-A-ba-B-Y-U
To my crew with a "Suuuuuuu"

[Ol Dirty Bastard]
C'mon, baby baby, c'mon, baby baby
C'mon, baby baby, c'mon

[RZA]
Yo, you best protect ya neck

[Verse 4: Ol Dirty Bastard]
First things first,[24] man, you're fuckin' with the worst[24]
I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a fuckin' nurse[24]
I'll attack[25] any nigga who slack[25] in his mack[25]
Come fully packed[25] with a fat rugged stack[25]
Shame on you[26] when you step through to[26]
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zu[26]
And I'll be damned[27] if I let any man[27]
Come to my center,[28] you enter[28] the winter[28]
Straight up and down, that shit is packed jam[29]
You can't slam,[29] don't let me get fool on him, man[29]
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin'
Ason Unique rollin' with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rollin' with a stash,[30] ain't sayin' cash[30]
Bite my style, I'll bite your motherfuckin' ass[30]

[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
For cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book[31] me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took[31] me
Ejectin'[32] styles from my lethal weapon[32]
My pen[32] that rocks from here to Oregon[32]
There's more again,[32] catch it like a psycho flashback[33]
I love gats; if Rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back[33]
I come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds[34]
And where I lounge[34] is my stompin' grounds[34]
I give an order[35] to my peeps across the water[35]
To go and snatch up props all around the border[35]
And get far[36] like a shootin' star[36]
'Cause who I are[36] is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar[36]
Point-blank as I kick the square biz[37]
There it is,[37] you're fuckin' with pros,[38] and there it goes[38]

[Verse 6: RZA]
Yo, chill with the feedback,[39] black,[39] we don't need that[39]
It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at?[39]
Feelin' mad hostile,[40] wearin' Aéropostale[40]
Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel[40]
Stroll with the holy robe,[41] then attack the globe[41]
With the buck-us[42] style, the ruckus[42]
Ten[43] times ten men[43] committin' mad sin[43]
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin[43]
Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums[44]
(He'll be) comin' around the mountain when I come[44]
Crazy flamboyant[44] for the rap enjoyment[44]
My clan increase like black unemployment[44]
Yeah, another one down
Ju-Jugger-Genius, take us the fuck outta here

[Verse 7: GZA]
The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels[45]
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel[45]
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel[45]
Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table[45]
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent[46]
Your empire falls and you lose every cent[46]
For tryna blow up a scrub[47]
Now that thought was just as bright[48] as a 20-watt light[48] bulb[47]
Should've pumped it when I rocked it[49]
Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets[49]
This goes on in some companies[50]
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these[50]
First of all, who's your A&R?[51]
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?[51]
But he don't know the meanin' of dope[52]
When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap
That's cleaner than a bar of soap[52]
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight[53]
Matter of fact, bring out the girls, and let's have a mud fight![53]

[Outro: RZA]
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck

Yo, there's no place to hide[1] as I step inside[1] the room[2]
Dr. Doom,[2] prepare for the boom[2]
Bam![3] Aw, man![3] I slam,[3] jam,[3] now scream like Tarzan[3]

I'm causin' more family feud than Richard Dawson[4]
And the survey said[5] you're dead[5]
Fatal Flying Guillotine chops off your fuckin' head[5]
MZA, who was that?[6] Ayo, the Wu is back[6]
Makin' niggas go Bo! Bo! like I'm Super Cat[6]
Me fear no one,[7] oh no, here come[7]
The Wu-Tang shogun,[7] killer to my eardrum[7]

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Put the needle to the groove,[8] I gets rude[8]
And I'm forced to fuck it up[9]
My style carries like a pick-up truck[9]
Cross the clear blue yonder, sea to shinin' sea[10]
I slam tracks[11] like quarterback[11] sacks[11] from L.T.[10]
Now why try and test[12] the Rebel INS?[12]
Blessed since the birth, I earth-slam your best[12]
'Cause I bake[13] the cake, then take the cake[13]
And eat it, too,[14] with my crew[14] while we head state to state[13]

[Bridge: All]
And if you want beef, then bring the ruckus![15]
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthing ta fuck wit[15]
Straight from the motherfuckin' slums that's busted[15]
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthing ta fuck wit

[Interlude: RZA]
Hah! Lebonon, step up, boy!
Represent! Chop his head off, kid!

[Verse 3: Method Man]
The Meth will come out tomorrow[16]
Styles, conditions, bizarre, bizarro[16]
Flow,[16] with more afro[16] than Rollo[16]
Comin' to a fork in the road, which way to go? Just follow[16]
Meth is the legend, niggas is sleepy hollow[16]
In fact I'm a hard act to follow[16]
I dealt for dolo,[16] Bogart comin' on through[17]
Niggas is like, "Oh my God, not you!"[17]
Yes, I[18] come to get a slice of the punk and the pie[18]
Rather do than die,[18] check my flavor[19]
Comin' from the RZA, which is short for The Razor[19]
Who[20] make me reminisce true[20]
Like déjà vu,[20] I'm rubber, niggas is like glue[20]
Whatever you say rubs off me sticks to you[20]

[Hook: RZA]
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit

[Outro: RZA]
Ahh-hah! Yeah! Representin' Brooklyn, Queens
Long Island, Manhattan, Bronx
The Rugged Lands of Shaolin
Niggas from Virginia, Atlanta, our boys in Ohio[21]
Comin' through with the crazy Y-O Y-O[21]
Yo, niggas from The Source
My man Kelly Woo from the Gavin
Will Strickland, Jason Staton, yeah
True, true, my nigga Crown, what's goin' down, boy?
We ain't nuthing ta fuck wit
The whole Texas mob, the Chicago mob
Niggas from Detroit, fuckin' California squadron
Comin' through, you know what I'm sayin'?
The whole fuckin' West Coast to the whole East
Niggas from D.C., down in Maryland
All the way over there in Morgan State
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthing ta fuck wit
All over the whole fuckin' globe, comin' through, boy
Peace to the fuckin' Zulu Nation
Peace to all the Gods and the Earths, word is bond
Wu-Tang slang, choppin' heads, boy
It ain't safe no more, peace!
