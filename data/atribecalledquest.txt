[[We the People....]]
[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
We don't believe[20] you[1] 'cause we the people[1]
Are still here[2] in the rear[2], ayo, we don't need[20] you[1]
You in the killing-off-good-young-nigga mood[3]
When we get hungry we eat the same fucking food[3]
The ramen noodle[4]
Your simple voodoo[4] is so maniacal[5], we're liable[5] to pull a juju[4]
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap[6]
She don't love me[7], she make money[7], she don't study[7] that[6]
She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back[6]
She gon' take the brain[8] to wetter plains[8], she spit on that[6]
The doors have signs[9] with, don't try to rhyme[9] with
VH1 has a show that you can waste your time[9] with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality[10]
And for a salary[10] I'd probably do that shit sporadically[10]
The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas[11]
The IRS piranha[11] see a nigga gettin' commas[11]
Niggas in the hood living in a fishbowl[12]
Gentrify here, now it's not a shit hole[12]
Trendsetter, I know, my shit's cold[12]
Ain't settling because I ain't so bold[12] but ay

[Hook: Q-Tip]
All you Black folks, you must go
All you Mexicans, you must go
And all you poor folks, you must go
Muslims and gays[13], boy, we hate your ways[13]
So all you bad folks, you must go

[Bridge: Phife Dawg & Q-Tip]
The fog[14] and the smog[14] of news media that logs[14]
False narratives of Gods[14] that came up against the odds[14]
We're not just nigga rappers with the bars[15]
It's kismet that we're cosmic with the stars[15]

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
You bastards overlooking street art[16]
Better yet, street smarts[16] but you keep us off the charts[16]
So motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians[17]
Fuck y'all know about true competition?[17]
That's like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin'[18]
The only one who's hitting[18] are the ones that's currently spittin'[18]
We got your missy smitten[18] rubbing on her little kitten[18]
Dreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division[18]
Boy, I tell you that's vision[18]
Like Tony Romo when he hitting[18] Witten[18]
The Tribe be the best in they division[18]
Shaheed Muhammad cut it with precision[18]
Who can come back years later, still hit the shot?[19]
Still them tryna move we off the fucking block[19]
Babylon, bloodclaat[19]
Two pon yuh headtop[19]

[Hook: Q-Tip]
All you Black folks, you must go
All you Mexicans, you must go
And all you poor folks, you must go
Muslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways
So all you bad folks, you must go

[[Electric Relaxation]]
[Hook]
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down

[Verse 1: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]

[Q-Tip]
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized[1]
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs[1]
Street poetry is my everyday[2]
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way[2]
If I was working at the club you would not pay[2]
Aiyyo, my man Phife Diggy, he got something to say[2]

[Phife Dawg]
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian[3]
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation[3]
Told you in the jam that we can get down[4]
Now let's knock the boots like the group H-Town[4]
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall[5]
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball[5]
A gritty little something on the New York street[6]
This is how I represent over this here beat[6]
Talking 'bout you

[Q-Tip]
Yo, I took you out[7]
But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route[7]
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state[8]
But I couldn't drop dimes cause you couldn't relate[8]

[Hook]
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down

[Verse 2: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]

[Q-Tip]
Stretch out your legs, let me make you bawl[9]
Drive you insane, drive you up the wall[9]
Staring at your dome-piece, very strong[10]
Stronger than pride, stronger than Teflon[10]
Take you on the ave and you buy me links[11]
Now I wanna pound the poontang until it stinks[11]
You can be my mama and I'll be your boy[12]

[Phife Dawg]
Original rude boy[12], never am I coy[12]
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy[12]
Not to come across as a thug or a hood[13]
But hon, you got the goods[13], like Madelyne Woods[13]
By the way, my name's Malik
The Five-Foot Freak[14]
Let's say we get together by the end of the week[14]
She simply said, "No"[15], labelled me a ho[15]
I said, "How you figure?" "My friends told me so"[15]
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap[16]
Word to God, hon, I don't get down like that[16]

[Q-Tip]
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak[17]
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep in my jeep[17]
Keep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet[17]
See, I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets[17]

[Phife Dawg]
If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope[18]
Let me save the little man from inside the boat[18]
Let me hit it from the back, girl I won't catch a hernia[19]
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture[19]

[Q-Tip]
Shaheed, Phife and the Extra P[20]
Stacy Beadle, PJ and my man L.G[20]
They know the Abstract is really soul on ice[21]
The character is of men, never ever of mice[21]
Shorty let me tell you about my only vice[21]
It has to do with lots of loving and it ain't nothing nice[21]

[Hook]
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down

[Outro]
Keep bouncing

[[Scenario]]
[Produced by A Tribe Called Quest]

[Hook]
Here we go[1], yo[1], here we go[1], yo[1]
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?[1]
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Heyo, Bo knows this (what?) and Bo knows that[2] (what?)
But Bo don't know jack[2], 'cause Bo can't rap[2]
Well what do you know? The Di-Dawg, is first up to bat[2]
No batteries included, and no strings attached[2]
No holds barred, no time for move fakin'[3]
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon[3]
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow[4]
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe[4], so[4]
Sleep if you want, NyQuil will help you get your Z's, troop[5]
But here's the real scoop[5]
I'm all that and then some,[6] short, dark and handsome[6]
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from[6]
I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here[7]
My days of paying dues are over, acknowledge me as in there[7]
(Yeah!) Head for the border, go get a taco[8]
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meaning from the get-go[8]
Sit back relax and let yourself go[8]
Don't sweat what you heard, but act like you know[8]

[Verse 2: Charlie Brown]
Yes yes y'all (Yes y'all!)
Who got the vibe[9], it's the Tribe[9] y'all (Tribe y'all!)
Real live[9] y'all (Live y'all!)
Inside, outside, come around[10]
(Who's that?) Brooown![10]
Some may, I say, call me Charlie[11]
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley[11]
Lay back[12] on the payback[12], evolve rotate the gates
(Contact!) Can I get a hit?[13] (...Hit!)
Boom bip[13] with a brother named Tip[13] and we're ready to flip[13]
East coast stomping[14], ripping and romping[14]
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton[14]
Checka-checka-check it out[15]
The loops[16] for the troops[16], more bounce[15] to the ounce[15]
And wow-how-now-wow[17], how[17] now[17], Brown[17] cow?[17]
We're ill[18] 'til[18] the skill[18] gets down
For the flex[19], next[19], it's the textbook[19] old to the new[20]
But the rest are doo-doo[20]
From radio[21], to the video[21], to Arsenio[21]
Tell me! Yo[21], what's the scenario?[21]

[Verse 3: Dinco D]
(True[22] blue!)[22] Scooby[23] Doo[22], whoopie[23] doo[22]
Scenarios[24], radios[24], rates more[25] than four[25]
Scores[25] for the smores[25] that smother dance floors[25]
Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore[25]
Ship-shape[26] crushed grapes[26] apes[26] that play tapes[26]
Papes[26] make drakes[26] baked[26] for the wakes[26]
Of an L-ah-, an -eader[27], simply just a leader[27]
Base[28] in the space[28] means peace, see ya later[29]
Later (later!) later, alligator[29]
Pop goes the weasel and the herb's the inflater[29]
So yo the D what the O[30]
Incorporate I-N-C into a flow[30]
Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight
Laugh yo, how'd that sound? (Ooh!)

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
It's a Leader Quest mission and we got the goods here[31] (Here!)
Never on the left 'cause my right's my good ear[31] (Ear!)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal[32]
Stay away from crime so I ain't no (criminal!)[32]
I love my young nation[33], groovy sensation[33]
No time for hibernation[33], only elation[33]
Don't ever try to test, the water, little kid[34]
Yo Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell him what I did[34]

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
I heard you rushed and rushed and attacked[35]
Then they rebuked and you had to smack[35]
Causing rambunction throughout the sphere[36]
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear[36]

[Verse 6: Q-Tip]
You know I did it
So don't violate or you'll get violated[37]
The hip-hop sound is well agitated[37]
Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego[38]
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario[38]

[Verse 7: Busta Rhymes]
Watch as I combine[39] all the juice from the mind[39]
Heel[40] up, wheel[40] up, bring it back, come, rewind[39]
Powerful impact (Boom!) from the cannon![41]
Not bragging[41], try to read my mind, just imagine![41]
Vo-cab-u-lary's necessary[42]
When digging in the mind library[42]
Oh-my-gosh! Oh my gosh![43]
Eating Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh[43]
Unh! Unh! Unh! All over the track[44], man
Unh, pardon me, unh! As I come back[44]
As I did it, yo, I had to beg your pardon[45]
When I travel through the town I roll with the squadron[45]
Roar, raow, like a dungeon dragon[46]
Change your little drawers 'cause your pants were saggin'[46]
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban[47]
And have you smelling ripe like some old, stale urine[47]
Chickity Choco, the chocolate chicken[48]
The rear cock diesel, buttcheeks, they were kicking[48]
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme[49]
The rhythm is in sync (Uh!) the rhymes are on time[49] (Time!)
Ripping up the sound just like Horatio[50]
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario[50]
Yeah, my man, mothafucka!

[Hook]
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?

[[Can I Kick It?]]
[Hook: Q-Tip]
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe[1] does[2]
Before this, did you really know what live[1] was?[2]
Comprehend to the track, for it's why[1] cuz[2]
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers[2]
Rock and roll to the beat[3] of the funk fuzz[2]
Wipe your feet[3] really good on the rhythm rug[2]
If you feel the urge to freak[3], do the jitterbug[2]
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug[2]
Afrocentric living is a big shrug[2]
A life filled with fun that's what I love[2]
A lower plateau is what we're above[2]
If you diss us, we won't even think of[2]
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?[2]
This rhythm really fits like a snug[2] glove[2]
Like a box of positives it's a plus,[2] love[2]
As the Tribe flies high like a dove[2]
(Can I kick it?)

[Hook: Phife Dawg]
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Can I kick it? To my Tribe that flows in layers[4]
Right now, Phife is a poem sayer[4]
At times, I'm a studio conveyor[4]
Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?[4]
You'll be doing us a really big favor[4]
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor[4]
When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior[4]
Follow us for the funky behavior[4]
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya[4]
Feel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir[4]
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer[4]
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor[4]
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major[4]
Yes, the Tribe of the game we're a player[4]
As you inhale like a breath of fresh air
(Can I kick it?)

[[Check the Rhime]]
[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, check the rhyme

[Verse 1: Q-Tip & (Phife Dawg)]
Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden[1]
We used to kick routines and presence was fittin[1]
It was I, The Abstract (And me, the Five Footer)[2]
(I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter)[2]
Yo, Phife, you remember that routine[3]
That we used to make spiffy like Mr. Clean?[3]
(Um um, a tidbit, um, a smidgen)[4]
(I don't get the message so you gots to run the pigeon)[4]
Heh, okay, you on point Phife? (All the time, Tip)
You on point Phife? (All the time, Tip)
You on point Phife? (All the time, Tip)[5]
Well, then grab the microphone and let your words rip[5]

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am[6]
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram[6]
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long[7]
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong[7]
Now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong[7]
I slayed that buddy in El Segundo then Push it Along[7]
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man[8]
'Cause you know and I know that you know who I am[8]
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals, you see[9]
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's[9]
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me[9]
They get vexed[10], I roll next,[10] can't none contest me[9]
I'm just a fly MC[9] who's five foot three[9] and very brave[11]
On top remaining[12], no home training[12] 'cause I misbehave[11]
I come correct[13] in full effect[13] have all my hoes in check[13]
And before I get the butt the jim must be erect[13]
You see, my aura's positive I don't promote no junk[14]
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk[14]
Extremity in rhythm, yeah that's what you heard[15]
So just clean out your ears and just check the word[15]

[Hook: Q-Tip]
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check it out, check it out
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, play tapes y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check it out, check it out

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg & (Q-Tip)]
Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin
It was I, the Phifer (And me, the Abstract)[16]
(The rhymes were so rumpin' that the brothers rode the 'zack)[16]
Ayo Tip, do you recall when we used to rock[17] (What?)
Those fly routines on your cousin's block?[17]
(Um, let me see, damn I can't remember)[18]
(I receive the message and you will play the sender)[18]
You on point Tip? (All the time Phife)
You on point Tip? (Yeah, all the time Phife)
You on point Tip? (Yo, all the time Phife)[19]
So play the resurrector and give the dead some life[19]

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Okay, if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock[20]
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock[20]
With speed, I'm agile[21] plus I'm worth your while[21]
One hundred percent intelligent black child[21]
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must you go to gain respect? Ummm
Well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own[22]
Or you'll be crazy, sad and alone[22]
Industry rule number four-thousand-and-eighty[23]
Record company people are shady[23]
So kids watch your back[24] 'cause I think they smoke crack[24]
I don't doubt it, look at how they act[24]
Well off to better things like a hip-hop forum[25]
Pass me the rock and I'll (score 'em)[25] with decorum[25]
And proper—what you say Hammer? Proper
Rap is not pop[26], if you call it that then stop[26]

[Outro: Q-Tip]
NC, y'all check the rhyme y'all
SC, y'all check it out y'all
Virginia, check the rhyme y'all
Check it out, check it out
In London, check the rhyme, y'all

[[Buggin' Out]]
[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Yo, microphone check one, two, what is this?[1]
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business[1]
I float like gravity[2], never had a cavity[2]
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family[2]
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame[3]
No shame[3] in my game[3] cause I'll always be the same[3]
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have[4]
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half[4]
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path[4]
Mess around with this you catch a size eight up your {ass}[4]
I never half step cause I'm not a half stepper[5]
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper[5]
Refuse to compete with BS competition[6]
Your name ain't Special Ed so won't you seckle with the mission[6]
I never walk the street thinking it's all about me[7]
Even though deep in my heart, it really could be[7]
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Zulu Nation[8], brothers last creation[8]
Minds get flooded, ejaculation[8]
Right on the two inch tape[9]
The Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape[9]
Not the best not the worst[10] and occasionally I curse[10]
To get my point across[11], so bust, the floss[11]
As I go in between, the grit and the dirt[12]
Listen[13] to the mission[13] listen Miss as I do work[12], umm
As I crack the, monotone[14]
Children of the jazz so, get your own[14]
Smokin R&B[15] cause they try to do me[15]
Or the best of the pack[16] but they can't do rap[16]
For it's Abstract[16], original[17]
You can't get your own and that's, pitiful[17]
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug[18]
On R&B, but I can't and that's bugged[18]

[Hook]
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg]
Yo when you bug out, you usually have a reason for the action[19]
Sometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction[19]
People be hounding[20], always surrounding[20]
Pulsing, just like a migraine pounding[20]
You don't really fret[21], you stay in your sense[21]
Camouflage your feeling, of absolute tense[21]
You soar off to another world, deep in your mind[22]
But people seem to take that, as being unkind[22]
"Oh yo he's acting stank," really on a regal?[23]
A man of the fame not a man of the people[23]
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much[24]
Riding on the train with no dough, sucks[24]
Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's[25]
If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying -- mic please[25]
Hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug[26]
If you do the result, will end up kind of bugged[26]

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Yo, I am not an invalid although I used to smoke the weed out[27]
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out[27]
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns[28]
Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun[28]
When I left for road, see, I was Boulevard status[29]
Battling a MC was when Tip was at his maddest[29]
It was one MC after one MC[30]
What the world could they be wanting see[30] from little old me[30]
Do I have the formula to save the world?[31]
Or was it just because I used to swipe the women and all the girls[31]
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid[32]
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did[32]
Supposed to be my man but now I wonder cause you're feeble[33]
I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils[33]
It's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out

[Hook]
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out

Bonita Applebum I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita, Bonita, Bonita

[Outro]
Ayo
Who’s having a ball?
And you know, they ask me to get on the mic
And they ask me
Can I kick it?
Word
(Yes you can!)
Can I kick it?

[[The Space Program]]
[Intro]
I’mma deal with a bigger insult, man
The heat, the heat, the heat, the heat
It's comin' down hard
We’ve got to get our shit together

[Chorus: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]
It’s time to go left and not right
Gotta get it together[1] forever[1]
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters[2]
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas[2]
For non-conformists, one hitter quitters[2]
For Tyson types and Che figures[2]
Let’s get it together, come on let’s make it
Gotta make it to make it, to make it, to make it, to make it
To make something happen, to make something happen
To make something happen, let’s make something happen

[Verse 1: Q-Tip & Jarobi]
Word to Phifer
Gonna bring it to the overlord[3], drinkin'[4] Cisco
Chilling[4] with the gold microphone cords[3]
And we grip our balls every time we stuntin' on tour[3]
'Cause we never bore[3], responding to the ready crowd's roar[3]
And promoters try to hit us with the art of war[3]
We about our business, we not quitters[5]
Not bullshitters[5], we deliver[5]—we go-get it
Don’t be bitter[5] 'cause we not just niggas[5]
Jarobi, my fiber wove into different[6] cloth[7]
Ain’t nothing forbidden, this nigga get his written[6] off[7]
Hardest spit in the city y’all niggas spitting kitten[6] soft[7]
Confused and amazed, shook up with your brain missing[6] lost[7]
They planning for our future
None of our people involved[7]
Pouring Henny and Smirnoff[7] to get it cracking off[7]
Cracking off[7] a Smirnoff[7] to quickly turn to Molotov[7]
Molotov[7] the spaceship doors before that bitch is taking off[7]
It always seems the poorest persons
Are people forsaken, dawg[8]
No Washingtons, Jeffersons, Jacksons
On the captain's log[8]
They’d rather lead us to the grayest water poison deadly smog[8]
Mass un-blackening[9], it’s happening[9], you feel it y’all?
Rather see[11] we[11] in a three-by-three[11] structure with many bars[10]
Leave us where we are[10] so they can play among the stars[10]
They taking off to Mars[10], got the space vessels overflowing[12]
What, you think they want us there? All us niggas not going[12]
Reputation[13] ain’t glowing[12], reparations[13] ain’t flowing[12]
If you find yourself stuck in a creek, you better start rowing[12]
Used to see the TV screen[14] as the place to land my dream[14] in
And the car stereo[15] where they would promote the show[15]
Optimistic little brother with a hope you know[15]

[Hook]
(Move on to the stars)
There ain’t a space program for niggas
Yeah, you stuck here, nigga
(Move on to the stars)
There ain’t a space program for niggas
Yeah, you stuck here nigga
(Move on to the stars)
There ain’t a space program for niggas
Yeah, you stuck here, nigga
(Move on to the stars)
There ain’t a space program for niggas
Yeah, you stuck, stuck, stuck
(Move on to the stars)

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Sit and wonder sometimes, I read the paper every day[16]
All these happenings is cycular, just happen different ways[16]
And the president's refined[17], in her wing she's confined[17]
With about thirty Percocets and five bottles of wine[17]
Carolina[18] nothing finer[18] than a Black woman who climbs[17]
To the top of the State building claiming that that flag is mine[17]
Now, people on top of people, feels like we can’t breathe[26]
Put so much in this muthafucka, feel like we shouldn't leave[26]
Put it on TV, put it in movies, put it in our face[19]
These notions and ideas and citizens live in space[19]
I chuckle just like all[20] of y'all[20], absurdity, after all[20]
Takes money to get it running and money for trees to fall[20]
Imagine for one second all the people are colored, please[21]
Imagine for one second all the people in poverty[21]
No matter the skin tone[22], culture or time zone[22]
Think the ones who got it
Would even think to throw you a bone?[22]
Moved you out your neighbourhood, did they find you a home?[22]
Nah cypher, probably no place to[23]
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude[23]
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude

[Chorus: Phife Dawg]
Time to go left and not right
Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformers, won’t hear the quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformists, one-hitter quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Make make make
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen
Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformists, one-hitter quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformists, one-hitter quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Make make make
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen
Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformists, one-hitter quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformists, one-hitter quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Make, make, make
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen

[Outro]
The danger must be growing[24]
For the rowers keep on rowing[24]
And they’re certainly not showing[24]
Any signs that they are slowing![24]
"We’re there!"
"Where?"
"Here!"
A small step for mankind
But a giant step for us
Oompa, loompa, doopa dee doo[25]
I’ve got another puzzle for you[25]

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
People give your ears so I be sublime[2]
It's enjoyable to know you and your concubines[2]
Niggas, take off your coats, ladies act like gems[3]
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns[3]
See, lyrically[5] I'm Mario Andretti[5] on the MOMO[4]
Ludicrously speedy[5], or infectious with the slow-mo[4]
Heard me in the eighties, J.B.'s on "The Promo"[4]
In my never-ending quest to get the paper[6] on the caper[6]
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air[7]
Hold up a second son, cause we almost there[7]
You can be a black man and lose all your soul[8]
You can be white and groove but don't crap the roll[8]
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf[9] or self[9], see there's no one else[9]
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do do that that that (come on)
Do that, do that, do do that that that (OK)
Do that, do that, do do that that that
I'm bugging out but let me get back cause I'm wetting niggas
So run and tell the others[10] cause we are the brothers[10]
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class[11]
So give me this award, and let's not make it the last[11]

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Back in '89 I simply slid in the place[12]
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face[12]
A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste[12]
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?[12]
I have a quest to have a mic[13] in my hand[14]
Without that, it's like Kryptonite[13] and Superman[14]
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts[15]
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt[15]
When was the last time you heard the Phife sloppy[16]
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy[16]
Top notch baby, never coming less[17]
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest[17]
Sit back, relax, get up out the path[18]
If not that, here's a dancefloor, come move that ass[18]
Non-believers, you can check the stats[18]
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract[18]
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam[19]
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am[19]
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees[20]
Living mad phat like an oversized mampi[20]
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh[21]
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft[21]
So, next time that you think you want somethin here[22]
Make something def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere[22]

[Outro]
Seven times out of ten we listen to our music at night, thus spawned the title of this program
The word maraud means to loot
In this case, we maraud for ears

[[Jazz (We've Got)]]
[Hook]
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Stern[1] firm[1] and young[2] with a laid-back tongue[2]
The aim is to succeed[3] and achieve[3] at 21[2]
Just like Ringling Brothers, I'll daze and astound[3]
Captivate the mass, cause the prose was profound[3]
Do it for the strong, we do it for the meek[4]
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep[4]
Or your Honda or your Beemer or your Legend or your Benz[5]
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends[5]
So push it, along[6], trails, we blaze[7]
Don't deserve the gong[6], don't deserve the praise[7]
The tranquility will make you unball your fist[8]
For we put Hip Hop on a brand new twist[8]
A brand new twist with a whole heap[10] of mystic[9]
So low-key[10] that you probably[10] missed it[9]
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd[11]
When the guy takes the beat, they bowed[11]
So raise up squire[12], adjust your attire[12]
We have no time to wallow in the mire[12]
If you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead[13]
Join in the essence of the cool-out breed[13]
Then cool out to the music cause it makes you feel serene[13]
With the birds and the bees and all those groovy things[13]
Like getting stomach aches[15] when you gotta go to work[14]
Or staring into space[15] when you're feeling berserk[14]
I don't really mind if it's over your head[16]
Cause the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead[16]
So pay attention, it's not hard to decipher[17]
And after the horns, you can check out the Phifer[17]

[Hook]
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Competition dem try fe come side way
But competition they must come straight way
Competition dem try fe come side way
But competition they must come straight way
How's about that, it seems like it's my turn again[18]
All through the years my mic has been my best friend[18]
I know some brothers wonder, can Phife really kick it?
Some even wanna dis me, but why sweat it?
I'm all into my music cos it's how I make papes[19]
Try to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes[19]
Me sweat another? I do my own thing[20]
Strictly hardcore tracks[21], not a new jack[21] swing[20]
I grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks[22]
Collect my banks[22], listen to Shabba Ranks[22]
I sing, and chat[23], I do all of that[23]
It's 1991 and I refuse to come wack[23]
I take off my hat[23] to other crews that tend to rock[24]
But the Low End Theory's here[25], it's time to wreck shop[24]
I got Tip and Shah, so whom shall I fear[25]
Stop look and listen, but please don't stare[25]
So jet to the store, and buy the LP[26]
On Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's[26]
Produced and arranged by the four-man crew[27]
And oh shit, Skeff Anselm, he gets props too[27]
Make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers[28]
So the new shit can rock, from Bronx to Massapequa[28]
Cause where I come[29] from[29] quality is job one[29]
And everybody up on Linden know we get the job done[29]
So peace to that crew[30], and peace to this crew[30]
Bring on the tour, we'll see you at a theatre nearest you[30]

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Hey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up[31]
Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut[31]
Back and forth just like a Cameo song[32]
If you dig this joint then please come dance along[32]
To the music cause it's done just for the rhyme[33]
Now I gotta scat and get mine[33], underline[33]
The jazz, the what? The jazz can move that ass[34]
Cause the Tribe originates that feeling of pizazz[34]
It's the universal sound[38], bless the brothers on the ground[38]
And the ones six below[35], you didn't have to go[35]
Some say that I'm eccentric cause I once had an orgy[36]
And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies[36]
If this is a stinker, then call me a skunk, I ask
("What's, wrong?") Now check it out

[Outro: Q-Tip]
All my peoples in Queens ya don't stop
Now all my peoples in Brooklyn ya don't stop
And all my peoples uptown ya don't stop
That includes the Bronx and Harlem ya don't stop
Now to that girl Ramelle ya don't stop
I said because Ladies First ya don't stop
And to the JB's, ya don't stop
And De La Soul, ya don't stop
To my Brand Nubians ya don't stop
And to my Leaders of the New ya don't stop
To my man Large Professor ya don't stop
Pete Rock for the beat ya don't stop
Everybody in the place ya don't stop
You keep it on, to the rhythm, ya don't stop[37]
And last but not least on the sure shot[37]
It's the Zulu nation

Who wanna spar?[8] Haha, well, here I are[8]
Orthodox spitter or bring on the southpaw[8]
No doubt I'mma set it, dudes best be ready[9]
Off top on the spot, no reading from your Whackberry[9]
Leave the iPhones home,[10] skill sets must be shown[10]
I'mma show you the real meaning of the danger zone,[10] huh
I got it sewn,[10] eh speak to all clones[10]
Untouchable in my zone,[10] watch it, don't leave him alone[10]
Fuck your ass cheek flows with bars sweeter than scones[10]
Put down microphone[10]

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Yes, yes, he the wrong ones to fuck with
No matter what the day[11]
He could catch you on his plane or the one you on today[11]
Visit niggas in their dreams
And make them scream of bloody murder[12]
He's a Trini gladiator, ain't no need to take it further[12]
If you wanna take it further your Huckleberry is here[13]
Doctor of your holiday, Wyatt Earp ya like the tears[13]
We gon' celebreate[14] him, elevate[14] him, papa had to levitate[14] him

Top dog is the way to rate[14] him

Dudes rude and as useless as coins,[9] shoot 'em boys[9]
Versed[10] in, rehearsed[10] in the soothing of loins[9]

Back in the days when I was a teenager[1]
Before I had status and before I had a pager[1]
You could find the Abstract listening to hip hop[2]
My pops[2] used to say, it reminded him of Bebop[2]
I said, "Well, daddy don't you know that things go in cycles[3]
Way that Bobby Brown is just amping like Michael"[3]
It's all expected, things are for the looking[4]
If you got the money,[5] Quest is for the booking[4]

Still got room[7] on the truckload[6] of black boom[7]
Listen to the rhymes, then get a mental picture[8]
Of this black man, and black woman fixture[8]
Why do I say that, cos I gotta speak the truth,[9] man[10]
Doing what we feel for the music is the proof[9] and[10]
Planted on the ground, the act is so together[11]
Bona fide strong, you need leverage to sever[11]
The unit, yes the unit, yes the unit called the jazz is
Delivering each year an LP filled with street goods
You can find it on your rack in your record store[12]
If you get the record, say your thoughts are adored[12]
And appreciated,[13] cause we're ever so glad we made it[13]
We work hard,[14] so we gotta thank God[14]
Dishing out the plastic,[15] do the dance till you're spastic[15]
If you diss... it gets drastic[15]
Listen to the rhyme, cause it's time to make gravy[16]
If it moves your booty, then shake, shake it baby[16]
All the way to Africa a.k.a the Motherland[17]
Stick out the left, then I'll ask for the other hand[17]
That's the right hand,[17] Black man[17]
Only if you are noted as my man[17]
If I get the credit, then I think I deserve it
If you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it
Get in the zone of positivity,[18] not negativity[18]
Cos we gotta strive for longevity[18]
If you botch up, what's in that ass[19]
(What?) A pair of Nikes size ten-and-a-half[19]

[Hook]
We gotta make[20] moves (words)
Never, ever, ever could we fake[20] moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves (words)
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

[Interlude]
Time, time is a ship on a merciless sea
Drifting toward an average of nothingness
Until it can be retarded for its own destiny
Time is an inanimate object
Praying and praying and praying with no justification for relief
Time is dancing, boogalooing away all memories of past

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
We gotta be a winner all the time[21]
Can't fall prey to a hip hop crime[21]
With the dope raps[22] and dope tracks[22] we move blocks[23]
From the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks[23]
Musically the Quest, is on the rise[24]
We on these excursions so you must realize[24]
That continually, I pop my Zulu shit[25]
If you don't like it, get off the Zulu tip[25]
So what can you do in the times which exist[26]
You can't fake moves on your brother or your sis[26]
But if your sis is a bitch, brother is a jerk[27]
Leave 'em both alone and continue with your work[27]
Whatever it may be in today's society[28]
Everything is fair, least that's how it seems to me[28]
You must be honest and true to the next[29]
Don't be phony and expect one not to flex[29]
Especially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen[30]
Your man is your man, then treat him like your friend[30]
All it is, is the code of the streets[31]
So listen to the knowledge being dropped over beats[31]
Beats that are hard, beats that are funky[32]
They could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie[32]
What you gotta do is know the Tribe is in the sphere[33]
The Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare[33]
(Or Edgar Allan Poe or Langston Hughes)

[Hook]
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

[Outro]
Time is running out on black power advocates in the day
And white thigh supporters at night
Every time you see them they're chasing some white woman
With their tongue hanging out
Time is running and passing, passing and running
Running and passing, passing and running...

[[Kids...]]
[Verse 1: André 3000]
I ain't even gon' lie,[1] I was probably high[1]
Just forgot to call you back,[2] simple as that[2]
I ain't no almanac,[2] so lick my dictionary[3]
I might just call a cab 'cause I dig canary[3]
Yellow accents on a dark bitch[4]
I met her back when she kept all her carpet[4]
I'm well aware all that shit is fantasy[5]
I double dare y'all to fuck your plan B[5]
That's demeanor, momma's mannerisms[6]
That mean, don't mean to get vulgar, but it's some[6]
Hoes[8] in this bitch like a box of donuts[7]
It's cold[8] out in this bitch, standing on the corner[7]
Condolences to niggas that got erased[9]
I pour out some liquor on a cop's grave[9]
Mmm, digital church bells[10]
Ringin' 'cross the street, sure work well[10]

[Hook: André 3000 & (Q-Tip)]

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
I don't wanna get up now, I don't wanna go to school[11]
I don't wanna be the best, don't wanna follow rules[11]
Mom, I think you fuckin' lied to me[12]
Three stacks said all this shit is fantasy[12]
It's my time, gon' put a little life[13] to[14] it
If life's a obstacle then I'mma bike[13] through[14] it
I see it like a kiddie on the carousel[15]
If I 'url while I go around, what the hell[15]
And that went well,[15] so I'm compelled[15]
To have visions[16] of getting[16] chicken[16] while my friends get jel[15]
My young nigga motto was, "Fuck it, I'm already grown"[17]
And I dream of when I'm sixteen, I'm out my home[17]
That petty though,[18] 'cause my mama boyfriend dough[18]
It's kinda long like this old head hustle, yo[18]
He cognizant of a nigga ride and die[19]
I see us getting money through my green eyes[19]

[Verse 3: André 3000 & Q-Tip]
Yeah, all the kids, all the what, uh
Yeah, all the badass kids, uh
Kids, say I'm the shit[21]
I'm Chick-fil-A nuggets, McDonald's french fries[20]
The spicy Popeye's[20] and Red Lobster biscuits[21]
And girls scout thin mints
Pardon my penmanship, but oh shit
Feel like I'm hungry now again[24]
And I can't do nothing about it[22] because my teeth are all rotted[22]
And my mom and my pop, they just grin[24]
And empathize with me[23] 'cause they were little like Pygmies[23]
But too bad they can't get back they 'member whens[24]
Them grown-up stories don't work
In the court of the kiddies', the judgement is in[24]
And while y'all doing all y'all your bids,[25] y'all reminisce as kids[25]
Fuck it, kids, the grown[26] -ups won't own[26] up
They stood on the corner[27]
Like you once upon a,[27] time
And probably felt like a loner[27]
And smelled like a stoner,[27] and snuck to Daytona[27]
So when they questioning you 'bout who or who you ain't boning[28]
Complaining that you always moaning[28]
Never saying good morning[28]
Storming out my house
And slamming doors like you paying bills
They been through it too, though
They were kids like you, though
But what if they knew though
And hit you with the cheat code
To a game you just start playing, no extra man
Leave you reckless on the court[29]
With no high percentage shot
Just a bunch of, "You got 'em, nigga, just give it what you got"[29]
Yeah, it look a little different on a yacht
But ain't gon' lie, I miss kayaking[30]
I love the young niggas, and they do too, they just be acting[30]
Like a bunch of retired tired thespians, a bit too salty[31]
Shit, their blood pressure high, why?
They don't play no more, probably[31]

Solid walls of sound (Jedi, Phifey, Phifey)

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg & Q-Tip]
Yo, ATCQ,[2] Massive and crew[2]
Bars to any beat, we beat the beat for true[2]
Massengale MC’s, you smell like pussy stew[2]
Don’t let it be you,[2] man up my youth[2]
Phife, you should've spoke[3] of, man you'rein the mode[3] of
Leave that to me,[4] el-Hajj Malik[4]
The man[5] with a plan[5] who made it real for us all[6]
Like Marauders on a mission when we killin' dance halls[6]
Mmm, Saga boy, Trini man[7]
Ride out when mic is in mi hand[7]
Loved all of mi fans,[7] one, two, three of dem all of the gang[7]

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes, Q-Tip & Phife]
With a couple pound a weed and a couple dollar van[7]
Hmm, broke pockets, find another plan[7]
Yeah, cyan dun, push up on the one
And big up the sound man, dibby dibby DJ walk[8]
Ayo Bus with them a talk[8]
They don’t want no prob, they don’t want no issue
Outline them in bloodclaat chalk[8]
Earlier in the night when we bring out the music[9]
With a box and a band killer sound boy movement[9]
Live and direct when it all goes down[10]
You an idiot boy, you don't wanna fuck round[10]
Big tune make the world go round[10]
Make way for the sound boy crown[10]
Don't you know we're the wickedest sound[10]
One box off in your face make a sound boy frown[10]

[Bridge: Elton John & A Tribe Called Quest]
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound

[Outro: Q-Tip & Elton John]
Sound checking, a million watts are shaking the room
In just a few hours you're gonna feel the burn
All of the goons are checking their guns at the door[11]
A solid wall of sound is here on tour[11]
It's gonna get loud—so no phones allowed
It's gonna get loud—so no phones allowed

[[Oh My God]]
[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Listen up everybody, the bottom line[1]
I'm a black intellect, but unrefined[1]
With precision like a bullet, target bound[2]
Just living like a hooker, the harlot sounds[2]
Now when I say the harlot, you know I mean the hot[3]
Heat of the equator, the broth that's in the pot[3]
Jalick, Jalick ya wind up ya hip[4]
Drafting of the poets, I'm the #7 pick[4]
Licks licks licks boy 'pon your backside[5]
Licks licks licks boy 'pon your backside[5]
Listen to the fader, Shaheed lets it glide[5]
Tip the earthly body, heaven's on my side[5]
Even in Santo Domingo[6] when I got a Gringo[6]
We got mics, when do we go?[6]
Know a little nigga who can rhyme when you ask me[7]
Short, dark, and plus his voice is raspy[7]

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
1 for the treble, 2 for the bass
You know the style Tip, it's time to flip this
I like my beats hard like two day old shit[8]
Steady eating booty MCs like cheese grits[8]
My man Al B. Sure, he's in effect mode[9]
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue[9]
It's not like honey dip would wanna get with me[10]
But just in case I own more condoms than T.L.C[10]
Now the formula is this: me, Tip, and Ali[10]
For those who can't count it goes 1-2-3[10]
The anti batty boy, big up is who I be[10]
Brothers find this hard to do but never me[10]
Some brothers try to diss but Malik, you see 'em bitching[11]
Me no care about them dibby MC, my shit is hitting[11]
Trini gladiator,[12] anti-hesitater[12]
Shaheed push the fader[12] from here to Grenada[12]
Mr Energetic,[13] who me sound pathetic?[13]
When's the last time you heard a funky diabetic?[13]
(I don't know man, I don't know man, I don't know man)
(I don't know, I don't know)

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
(Repeat x8)

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Complementary[14] are we,[14] the three for poetry[14]
I got a humdinger[15] coming hook line and sinker[15]
The Timbo hoofs with the prints on the ground[16]
Timbos on the toes, I like the way it's going down[16]
Down like a lady of the evening[17]
When it goes in Toots just believe it's in[17]
Cause Queens is the county, Jamaica is the place[18]
Take off your cleats cause you can't run the race[18]

[Hook]
(Repeat to fade)

[Outro]
The title MC means Master of Ceremony
Some people who MC don't know what this term means

[[Find a Way]]
[Hook]
Now you caught my heart for the evening[1]
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things[1]
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way

[Q-Tip]
Messing me up, my whole head
Teasing me, just like Tisha did Martin[2]
Now look at what you're starting[2]
Schoolboy's crush[3] and it ain't on the hush[3]
The whole world sees it but you can't[4] (uh)
My peoples they complain, sit and rave and rant[4] (come on)
Your name is out my mouth like an ancient chant[4] (say what?)
Got me like a dog as I pause and pant...[4]

[Phife]
Speaking of which,[5] got a leash and I wish[5] just to rock you miss[5] (come on)
Make a militant move, peep my strategy[6] (what?)
End of the day you're not mad at me[6] (uh)
Not dealing with nobody, now that's what you told me[6] (what?)
I said: "hey yo, it's cool, we can just be friendly"[6] (come on)
Cause yo, picture me messing it up[7]
Her mind now corrupt[7] with the ill C-Cups[7]
Shit, I'm on my J.O.[8] (come on)
Bullshitting, hoping that the day goes slow[8] (what?)
Got me like a friend, what confuses me though[8]
Is kisses when we breeze, tell me what's the deal yo?[8] (deal yo, yo, yo...)

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Q-Tip]
Now why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?[9]
Making things for me towards you harder[9]
Killing me, just when I think we're there[9]
You douse the whole vibe and the flows in the air[9]
Telling me 'bout next man[10]
But next man ain't the nigga with the plan[10]
Who got your heart in mind?[11]
It's about time that you just unwind[11] (come on)

[Phife]
And let it just happen, make it front-free[12] (uh)
Just sweat me like Moneypenny[12] (uh)
Digging you, getting inside of your stee[12] (what?)
It's the Quest cat keeping you company[12]
Forever,[13] or however[13] you want it

[Q-Tip]
Word word,[14] now wait a minute Ma before you jet into the curb[14] (yeah, yeah)
Start to make affections, which is good not the herb[14]
But it, it ain't me, and I, I ain't blurred[14] (uh)
I'mma still just chill with you[15]
Maybe things could change if you change your view[15] (come on)
If not then I guess it is cool[15] (yeah)
Just, to keep to yourself and abide by the rules,[15] right

Check it out now...
Check it out now...
Like that now...
Check it out now...
Wha wha now...
Check it out now...
Yeah yeah now...
Check it out now...
Check it out now...
It's like that now...
Check it out now...
Yeah yeah now...
Check it out now...
What you say, what? what?

[[Whateva Will Be]]
[Intro]
Girl, this motherfucker's got rhythm

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Say am I 'posed to be dead or doin' life in prison?[1]
Just another dummy caught up in the system[1]
Unruly hooligan who belongs in Spofford[2]
Verse getting that degree at Stanford or Harvard[2]
Threatened by my work ethic, the way I speak,[3] yo
Should I be mentally weak,[3] verse being Malik?[3] Yo
Should I be trapped in the trap?[4] Would you prefer that?[4]
Fourth grade reading level but he knows how to rap[4]
Are you amused by our struggles? The English that's broken?[5]
The weed that I'm smokin'?[5] The guns that I'm totin'?[5]
The drugs that I'm sellin'? No need for improvement[6]
Fuck you and who you think I should be, forward movement[6]

[Verse 2: Jarobi]
Melanated shrouded in complexity[7]
Brain charge shocking like 'lectricity[7]
Mouth translate happens organically[7]
The media relates it what it thinks it sees[7]
Judging steps in shoes of a path they never walked[8]
Shot down in a blaze of a phrases is how they talk[8]
Dark skinned, walk with a bot portrayed villain[9]
I'm chillin',[9] felon down to the DNA crime willin'[9]
Subliminate their youth, hyper-sexualize their women[9]
They ain't got the strong enough hold, so they built the prisons[9]
Pumping false religions[9] to all of these niggas' systems[9]
Every voice devoid of the truth
Come on, listen[9]

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Man look at this, man look at this
Whatever will be will be[10]
Like a billionaire investin' in a nigga's dreams[10]
Certainly a head scratcher,[11] like Pac and Big's killers' capture[11]
Or a women with the wisdom who's leadin' the way[12]
The rarity is in the rear, but never today[12]
Man, picture a PD lettin' good records play[12]
On the strength of what it is,[13] not the finesse of your biz[13]
And your lady calls you dirty, her dirts under rugs[14]
You'll find out only if she tells you, take her kiss and hug,[14] cuz[14]
In the answer[15] for cancer[15] in a prodigious kid's mind
Yes, the government will fund,[16] learning is free for everyone[16]
And from that lie, young leaders will rise[17]
In the eyes[17] of despair and adversity[18]
In some universe, this verse will be[18] true

[Hook: Q-Tip]
Everybody runnin'[19] when they see the storm's comin'[19]
But whatever's gonna be will be
Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'
But whatever's gonna be will be
Some will dash to the mountain, some will crawl[20]
And the weakest amongst them, they will fall[20]
But the strongest in faith, they will stand tall[20]
Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'
But whatever's gonna be will be

[Verse 4: Consequence]
I just wanna feel as liberated as lions in Liberia[21]
'Cause recently my heart turned cold as Siberia[21]
'Cause everywhere I go, bein' cold is the criteria[21]
Let's see how well you know all your Tribe trivia[21]
Green and the white, we servin' that Nigeria[21]
North side of Queens, one-nine-two is the area[21]
This is for my dawgs from Shih Tzus to Terriers[21]
Fuck it, it's showtime, Tip, make sure they hearing you[21]

[[Sucka Nigga]]
[Intro]
"Hey sucker nigga, whoever you are"
"Hey sucker nigga, whoever you are"
"Hey sucker nigga, hey sucker nigga"
"Whoever you are, whoever you are"

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
I be hating sucker MCs, and the sucker niggas[2]
Posing like they hard[1] when we know they damn card[1]
What you figure,[2] rhyme-wise I do the figure eight so concisely[3]
Musically we are the herb so sit back and light me[3]
Inhale...[4]
My style is kinda fat reminiscent of a whale[4]
Young girls desires older female dreams[5]
I be the Abstract Poetic representing from Queens[5]
Socially I'm not inane,[6] black and white got game[6]
If you came to the jam, well I'm glad you came[6]
See, nigga first was used back in the Deep South[7]
Falling out between the dome of the white man's mouth[7]
It means that we will never grow, you know the word dummy[8]
Upper niggas in the community think it's crummy[8]
But I don't, neither does the youth cause we em-
Brace[9] adversity it goes right with the race[9]
And being that we use it as a term of endearment[10]
Niggas start to bug, to the dome is where the fear went[10]
Now the little shorties say it all of the time[11]
And a whole bunch of niggas throw the word in they rhyme[11]
Yo I start to flinch, as I try not to say[12] it
But my lips is like the oowop as I start to spray[12] it
My lips is like a oowop as I start to spray it
My lips is like a oowop as I start to spray the

[Hook: Q-Tip]
Sucka nigga, nigga nigga
I throw the sucka in the front for the ones that front
It's the neo-nigga of the nineties c'mon

[Outro]
Aiyyo Shaheed, take us the fuck outta here
You're not any less of a man, if you don't pull the trigger
You're not necessarily a man, if you do
