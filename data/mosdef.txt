[[Mathematics]]
[Intro]
Bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka, haha!
You know the deal: it's just me, yo[1]
Beats by Su-Primo[1] for all of my people, negroes[1] and latinos[1]
And even the gringos[1]

[Verse 1]
Yo, check it
One for Charlie Hustle, 2 for Steady Rock[2]
3 for the forthcoming live future shock[2]
It's 5 dimensions, 6 senses
7 firmaments of heaven and hell,[3] 8 Million Stories to tell[3]
9 planets faithfully keep in orbit with the probable tenth[4]
The universe expands length[4]
The body of my text possess[5] extra strength[4]
Power-lift the powerless[5] up out of this towering inferno[6]
My ink so hot it burn through the journal[6]
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle[6]
Hip-Hop passed all your tall social hurdles[6]
Like the nationwide project[7] -prison-industry complex[7]
Working-class poor: better keep your alarm set[7]
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
For ch-ching, cats get the "cha-pow!"[8] You dead now[8]
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow[8]
It's a numbers game, but shit don't add up somehow[8]
Like I got, 16 to 32 bars to rock it[9]
But only 15% of profits[9] ever see my pockets[9] like
69 billion in the last 20 years[10]
Spent on national defense but folks still live in fear[10] like
Nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black[11]
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack[11]
16 ounces to a pound, 20 more to a ki[12]
A 5-minute sentence hearing and you're no longer free[12]
40% of Americans own a cell phone[13]
So they can hear everything that you say when you ain't home[13]
I guess Michael Jackson was right: "You Are Not Alone"[13]
Rock your hardhat, black, cause you in the Terrordome[13]
Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice-tumblers[14]
Young teens[15] and prison greens[15] facing life numbers[14]
Crack mothers, crack babies and AIDS patients[16]
Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you in PlayStation[16]
This new math is whipping motherfuckers' ass[17]
You want to know how to rhyme you better learn how to add[17]
It's mathematics

[Hook]
"The Mighty Mos Def"
"It's simple mathematics"
"Check it out"
"I revolve around science.."
"What are we talking about here?"
"The Mighty Mos Def"
"It's simple mathematics"
"Check it out"
"I revolve around science.."
"What are we talking about here?"
"Do your math, do your math"
"1, 2, 3, 4"
"What are we talking about here?"

[Verse 2]
Yo
It's one universal law but 2 sides to every story[18]
3 strikes and you be in for life, mandatory[18]
4 MC's murdered in the last 4 years[19]
I ain't trying to be the fifth one, the millennium is here[19]
Yo it's 6 Million Ways to Die, from the 7 deadly thrills[20]
8-year olds getting found with 9mils[20]
It's 10 P.M., where your seeds at? What's the deal?
He on the hill[21] pumping krill[21] to keep they belly filled[21]
Light in the ass with heavy steel,[21] sights on the pretty shit in life[22]
Young soldiers trying to earn their next stripe[22]
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe you've got to find a new grind to get C.R.E.A.M
The white unemployment rate? It's nearly more than triple for black[23]
Some front-liners got their gun in your back[23]
Bubbling crack,[23] jewel theft and robbery[24] to combat poverty[24]
And end up in the global jail economy[24]
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence[25]
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence[25]
And even if you get out of prison still living[26]
Join the other 5 million[26] under state supervision[26]
This is business:[27] no faces, just lines and statistics[27]
From your phone, your zip code to S-S-I digits[27]
The system break man, child, and women into figures[28]
2 columns for "who is" and "who ain't niggas"[28]
Numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings
But you push too hard, even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camel's back?
Here's the secret[29]
The million other straws underneath it:[29] it's all mathematics (math)

[[Ms. Fat Booty]]
[Hook]
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget

[Intro]
Man, duke I was in love with this girl, duke
I was tore up dog, I'm telling you man
Shit is wild man, for real
It's, she's from, let me tell you about her

[Verse 1]
In she came[1] with the same type game[1]
The type of girl giving out the fake cell phone and name[1]
Big fame,[1] she like cats with big things[1]
Jewels chipped,[2] money clip,[2] phone flip,[2] the six range[1]
I seen her on the Ave, spotted her more than once[3]
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front[3]
She spot me[4] like paparazzi,[4] shot me a glance[5]
In that catwoman stance[5] with the fat booty pants,[5] hot damn!
What's your name love, where you came from?
Neck and wrist laced[6] up, very little make[6] -up
The swims at the Reebok gym tone your frame[6] up[7]
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made[6] of?[7]
I tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down[8]
Asked her to dance and she was like, "Yo, I'm leaving now"[8]
An hour later,[9] sounds from Jamaica[9]
She's sipping Cris straight up,[9] skanking, winding her waist up[9]
Scene 2 - my fam's throwing a jam[10]
Fareed is on the stand,[10] big things is in the plans[10]
The brother Big Mu[11] makes space for me to move[11]
"Ayo, this my man Mos, baby, let me introduce"[11]
I turned around (Say word![12]) it was the same pretty bird[12]
Who I had priorly observed[12] trying to play me for the herb[12] (Yeah, that's how)
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together[13]
I just played along and pretended I never met her[13]
How you feeling? "Oh, I'm fine" My name is Mos "I'm Sharice"[14]
I heard so much good about you, it's nice to finally meet[14]
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially[15]
And honey love ended up sitting directly next to me[15]
I'm type polite but now I'm looking at her skeptically[15]
Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry[15]
Designer fabric, shoes and accessories[15]
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fucking with me mentally[15]
We conversated, made her laugh, yeah, you know me bro[16]
Even though I know the steelo,[16] she wild sweet, yo[16]
I'm 'bout to murk, I say peace to the family[17]
She hop up like, "How you gon' leave before you dance with me?"[17]

[Hook]
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget

[Interlude]
She blew my whole head with that duke, I was like, word?
I played it low though, I was like, yeah, aight, come on then, let's go
Niggas was mad, niggas was so sick, I tell (ya)
Yo, honey was so blazing she was just
Yo, she looked like Jayne Kennedy, word bond, to my mother man
She was that ill man, she take me to the dance floor
And she start whispering to me (and shit)

[Verse 2]
Yo, let me apologize for the other night[18]
I know it wasn't right,[18] but baby you know what it's like[18]
Some brothers don't be coming right,[18] I understand, I'm feeling you[19]
Besides, can I have a dance ain't really that original[19]
We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades[20]
They playing Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist[20]
Heating my blood up like the Arizona summer[21]
Song finished then she whispered, "Honey, let's exchange numbers"[21]
Scene 3 - weeks of dating[22] late night conversation[22]
In the crib heart racing,[22] trying to be cool and patient[22]
She touched on my eyelids,[23] the room fell silent[23]
She walked away smiling, singing Gregory Isaacs[23]
Like, "If I don't, if I don't have you"[24]
Showing me her tan line and her tattoo[24]
Playing Sade, Sweetest Taboo[24]
Burning candles,[25] all my other plans got cancelled[25]
Man I smashed it like a Idaho potato[26]
She call me at my J.O.,[26] come now, I can't say no[26]
Ginseng tree trunks,[27] rocking the P-funk[27]
Cocking her knees[28] up,[27] champion lover not ease[28] up[27]
Three months, she call I feel I'm running a fever[29]
Six months, I'm telling her I desperately need her[29]
Nine months, flu-like symptoms when shorty not around[30]
I need more than to knock it down, I'm really trying to lock it down[30]
Midnight we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know, sweetheart I got to have it
She telling me commitment is something she can't manage
Wake up the next morning, she gone like it was magic[31]
Ahh, damn it,[31] my shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic[31]
My 911's unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, Mu hit me up, I saw Sharice at the Kittie club
With some banging ass Asian playing lay it down and lick me up
What!?
